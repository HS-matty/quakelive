[22:13] <PerpetualWar> wormking ?
[22:13] <fx> 22:13 -CAPickupBot(~CAPickupB@CAPickupBot.users.quakenet.org)- Player error: Player is locked [23 hours 59 minutes 52 seconds remaining]
[22:13] <fx> working
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> so locking is without pikup type
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> global
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> !unlock

[22:13] <PerpetualWar> !lock teste 1d
[22:14] * CAPickupBot changes topic to ' | '
[22:14] <teste> !a
[22:14] <PerpetualWar> !unlock teste
[22:14] <fx> PerpetualWar: maybe splitting lock by gametypes was in some 'next' branch
[22:14] <fx> dont remember
[22:14] <fx> but now it looks like only a global lock
[22:14] <PerpetualWar> ok
[22:15] <PerpetualWar> is theer !ban ?
[22:15] <fx> PerpetualWar: https://github.com/vityafx/jaibo/tree/master/ext/games/pickupbot/src/main/java/games/pickupbot/commands/messagelisteners
[22:15] <PerpetualWar> or not ?
[22:15] <fx> all commands by message are there
[22:15] <fx> sec gonna check for ban )
[22:15] <PerpetualWar> I can ban with Q no prob
[22:15] <PerpetualWar> just wanna know if its there
[22:15] <fx> i dont remember
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> ok dont bother with that
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> listen
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> one more thing I dont understand
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> someone do !iam
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> it supposedly makes profile in db
[22:16] <fx> it may crash some time, I dont remember the origin of this problem. You should know that. Contact me if it happens
[22:16] <fx> yesa
[22:16] <fx> it does
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> ok then I try to do !get_profile for that person
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> and it says no profile is there
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> only when I !set_profile
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> I can get_profile
[22:17] <fx> it is not working as simple as that
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> I cannot get_profile when only !iam
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> ye maybe Im missing something
[22:17] <fx> it was very hard for me the time I was developing the bot
[22:17] <fx> to get people irc assoc
[22:18] <fx> so it should be explicitly given to the command
[22:18] <fx> no the nick
[22:18] <fx> like
[22:18] <fx> !get_profile vitya@users.quakenet.org
[22:18] <fx> or something
[22:18] <fx> try
[22:18] <fx> I( doint remember
[22:18] <fx> :)
[22:18] <PerpetualWar> !get_profile vitya@users.quakenet.org
[22:18] <PerpetualWar> hm no
[22:18] <fx> no, use my irc info
[22:18] <fx> man
[22:18] <fx> use /whois
[22:19] <fx> on me
[22:19] <fx> and get by host
[22:19] <PerpetualWar> !get_profile ~vitya@vitya.users.quakenet.org
[22:19] <PerpetualWar> oh right
[22:19] <PerpetualWar> working like that
[22:19] <fx> working?
[22:19] <fx> and what does it say?
[22:19] <PerpetualWar> 20:19 from CAPickupBot - Host=[~vitya@vitya.users.quakenet.org] is bound to game profile=[FX]
[22:19] <fx> okay
[22:19] <fx> you may also change bindings
[22:19] <fx> but only admins can do that
[22:19] <fx> not player
[22:19] <fx> if a player has already a bind - it cant change it
[22:20] <fx> he will need to ask an admin
[22:20] <PerpetualWar> ye I saw that
[22:20] <PerpetualWar> I do that with !change_profile
[22:20] <PerpetualWar> correct ?
[22:20] <fx> yes, just looks at the source of the command handlers
[22:20] <fx> there is english
[22:20] <fx> you may read
[22:20] <fx> L)
[22:20] <PerpetualWar> ok
[22:21] <PerpetualWar> can bot take commands from some other channke |
[22:21] <PerpetualWar> ?
[22:21] <PerpetualWar> channel* ?
[22:22] <fx> as far as I remember it may sit on any number of channels you want
[22:22] <fx> and accept commands
[22:22] <fx> but it shares same instance between all the channels
[22:22] <fx> just like one bot taking many inputs
[22:23] <PerpetualWar> ok thats what Im asking
[22:23] <fx> I dont remember, try
[22:23] <PerpetualWar> so only thing is it my crash ?
[22:23] <fx> give me the log file
[22:23] <PerpetualWar> happens often ?
[22:23] <fx> no
[22:23] <fx> it depends well
[22:23] <fx> dont know
[22:23] <fx> used it like 4 months ago
[22:23] <fx> it was quite stable that time
[22:23] <PerpetualWar> what bot is used on qlpickup.ru ?
[22:24] <fx> dont know
[22:24] <fx> but not jaibo
[22:24] <PerpetualWar> whos bot admin there?
