[14:56] <kanzo> i dont get that error when using the python3.5 from https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/ubuntu/deadsnakes

[15:16] <Gelenkbus> ok i'm stupid, how do link x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc gcc 
[15:16] <Gelenkbus> x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc to gcc
03[15:19] * LtC (~nnscript@oMgLunatiC.users.quakenet.org) has joined #minqlbot
[15:20] <@Mino> 1: do "which x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc" to find where it is.
[15:20] <@Mino> 2: rename it to "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc-4.8"
[15:21] <@Mino> 3: do "which gcc" to find where it is
[15:21] <@Mino> 4: ln -s path/to/gcc path/to/x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
[15:21] <@Mino> 5: repeat the same with g++
[15:21] <Gelenkbus> awesome thanks much!!
[15:22] <@Mino> To confirm it worked, you can do "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc --version" and see it's 4.9
[15:22] <@Mino> If it is, you can just go ahead and repeat the easy_install thing
[15:22] <@Mino> I'll spam a bunch of warnings, but you can ignore those

[18:21] <mattiZed> man
[18:21] <mattiZed> fallout is buggy as hell, heh
[18:21] <@Mino> Indeed
[18:21] <@Mino> And the UI is so bad
[18:23] <mattiZed> have you been to the area with the water were you should fix the pipes? dude, wtf
[18:23] <@Mino> Yeah
[18:23] <mattiZed> textures and clipping completely fucked there
[18:23] <mattiZed> ....
[18:25] <@Mino> The physics were also really fucked up there. I was diving in there and found like a room, and as soon as I entered the water physics went away
[18:25] <@Mino> I'd just drop to the floor as if I wasn't in the water
[18:29] <@Mino> This is really messed up: http://minomino.org/screenshots/jpwY_2015-11-13_16-15-58.png
[18:29] <@Mino> 0, 3 and 5 have the same Steam ID. 13 and 18 have the same too.
[18:30] <@Mino> Not only that, but QLDS edited access.txt on the server and put 3 as admin.
[18:37] <sno> not buggy at all mattiZed http://squee.st0ner.co.uk/fallout4/2015-11-11_00001.jpg 
[18:37] <sno> :D
[18:38] <sno> still less buggy than fo3 so far, only 1 freeze for me
[18:54] <MrButcher> i guess i need some help again
[18:54] <MrButcher> i installed your extension, and start up the server first time with the mino script, and i get
[18:54] <MrButcher> quakelive@ubuntu:~$ ./runmyminoserver.sh
[18:54] <MrButcher> ERROR: ld.so: object './minqlx.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64): ignored.

[19:14] <Fraggan> Hello
[19:15] <@Mino> MrButcher: minqlx is x64 only at the moment. You launched the x86 build of the server.
[19:15] <@Mino> Hi, Fraggan
[19:15] <PerpetualWar_> hi Mino
[19:16] <@Mino> Hi
[19:16] <PerpetualWar_> when I wanna update your bot
[19:16] <PerpetualWar_> on my server
[19:16] <PerpetualWar_> how to do that ?
[19:16] <@Mino> What version are you on?
[19:16] <PerpetualWar_> thats good question
[19:16] <@Mino> If you're above v0.0.1, then it's just a matter of downloading the tarball and extracting it in your qlds directory.
[19:17] <PerpetualWar_> ye Im above that
[19:17] <PerpetualWar_> for sure
[19:17] <PerpetualWar_> ok
[19:19] <PerpetualWar_> Im on 0.0.3
[19:19] <@Mino> Oh, and you should do a git pull while in the minqlx-plugins directory
[19:20] <PerpetualWar_> from server ? Whats command for that ?
[19:21] <Fraggan> Mino: vad har du f√∂r grejer som du arbetar p√• just nu? H√•ller p√• att fixa ig√•ng en server som jag kan testa lite p√• och se om jag kan bist√• med n√•got.
[19:21] <MrButcher> thanks mino, i used the x64 now and it fires up
[19:22] <mattiZed> :D
[19:22] <mattiZed> that /players output up there
[19:22] <mattiZed> heh
[19:22] <mattiZed> what have you done, Mino :D
[19:23] <MrButcher> !myperm reads "you can do anything to me, master" :D
[19:24] <MrButcher> how can i activate that speach thing, haha yeah and so on ?
[19:24] <Fraggan> !load fun
[19:24] <Fraggan> To acitivate the "fun" things
[19:24] <Fraggan> i think it was
[19:24] <Fraggan> ey btw Butcher =)
[19:24] <MrButcher> no such plugin
[19:26] <@Mino> Sorry, had to go AFK a bit.
[19:26] <@Mino> A simple "git pull origin" should do it
[19:27] <Fraggan> I have to fix my keyb before i can code anything. The "f" key doesnt work. :/ hard to program with out it haha
[19:28] <MrButcher> git pull origin? was that for me?
[19:28] <PerpetualWar_> fo rme
[19:28] <MrButcher> ah ok
[19:28] <MrButcher> getting confused
[19:28] <@Mino> Fraggan: If you look at the v0.2.0 milestone on the main repo, you'll see what I'm going to work with when it comes to the core module. For plugins, I haven't really made a list of things to do, but I'd like to get fun, irc and silence plugins working for this one too.
[19:29] <@Mino> The current fun plugin is still just sitting on my local disk. I need to make some changes to it before it goes live.
[19:29] <@Mino> I'll try to get it up soon.
[19:29] <@Mino> I can just pastebin it in the mean time if you want the one I use on my server
[19:30] <@Mino> mattiZed: Not sure if that's me. I really hope it isn't, at least.
[19:30] <@Mino> Although the access.txt editing is definitely not me
[19:30] <@Mino> It's the second time I notice some random guy becoming admin all of a sudden
[19:30] <@Mino> I hadn't even touched addadmin/mod or demote
[19:30] <@Mino> Really messed up
[19:31] <MrButcher> i wait for your live version, enough things i can set up meanwhile. thanks
[19:31] <@Mino> Alright
[19:32] <tjone270> So you've already made progress on porting fun.py across? I was going to give it a try. I've noticed admin issues too, I was demoted on a map change, had to fg the quake process and addadmin myself
[19:32] <Fraggan> Okej, gonna check. Havent used git that much, will try to get familiar with it =)
[19:33] <Fraggan> Mino: Are u devel in win or linux?
[19:39] <MrButcher> can i put these commands, e.g. !setmotd also into server.cfg?
[19:45] <@Mino> Fraggan: I code in Windows, but the target is obviously Linux
[19:45] <@Mino> MrButcher: No, you don't put commands in the config, only cvars.
[19:46] <@Mino> The MOTD is saved in the database, so you only need to do it once
[19:46] <tjone270> Mino, have you already started porting fun.py across?
[19:46] <@Mino> It's not really a port. Just a plugin with some silly stuff.
[19:47] <@Mino> I'll add some of the old stuff in it too, though
[19:47] <tjone270> Okay :)
[19:49] <MrButcher> is there a nicer way to stop the server other then ctrl-c?
[19:50] <MrButcher> it worked fine before, but with the extension i see
[19:50] <MrButcher> [minqlx.log_exception] ERROR: KeyboardInterrupt
[19:50] <MrButcher> [minqlx.log_exception] ERROR:

[19:50] <@Mino> You ctrl+c'd
[19:51] <MrButcher> yes
[19:51] <@Mino> That's an exception in PYthon
[19:52] <mattiZed> just type "quit" in the server's console...
[19:53] <MrButcher> i used kill -9 already ......
[19:53] <MrButcher> i dont have a console to the server open
[19:53] <tjone270> kill -9's overkill
[19:53] <tjone270> pun intended
[19:53] <MrButcher> i just had the terminal i started the server with
[19:54] <MrButcher> how to i open a server console?
[19:54] <@Mino> That's the console
[19:54] <MrButcher> ah ok :D
[19:54] <@Mino> You can type stuff right in there
[19:55] <PerpetualWar_> Mino, can you put in readme how to donwload python3.5 foir ubuntu ?
02[19:55] * LtC|afk (~nnscript@oMgLunatiC.users.quakenet.org) Quit (Ping timeout)
[19:56] <PerpetualWar_> was it wily ?
[19:56] <PerpetualWar_> or ?
[19:57] <mattiZed> perp: you can add the official repository for ubuntu 15
[19:59] <@Mino> I'll add it to the wiki probably
[19:59] <@Mino> and yeah, wily, which is Ubuntu 15.10 has it in the official repo
[19:59] <@Mino> if you use an older version, you can add the repo manually
[19:59] <@Mino> Just copy the line that's like http://some_url.com <codename> main
[19:59] <@Mino> and put wily there for the codename
[20:00] <PerpetualWar_> ye ok I go tthat
[20:00] <PerpetualWar_> but Mino
[20:00] <PerpetualWar_> listen
[20:01] <PerpetualWar_> is it smart to change repos on server where I have other stuff like web server
[20:01] <PerpetualWar_> could broke something there ?
[20:02] <PerpetualWar_> or Im worrying too much ?
[20:02] <@Mino> It won't matter since you're only installing python
[20:02] <@Mino> as long as you remove the repo from sources.list after you're done
[20:03] <PerpetualWar_> but Im gonna do apt-get update
[20:03] <PerpetualWar_> that wont update all other stuff as well besides python ?
[20:04] <mattiZed> this will only update your packet manager
[20:05] <mattiZed> remove the repo, do apt-get update again and everything will be as before
[20:05] <mattiZed> *updating the packet manager's lists, to be precise
[20:05] <PerpetualWar_> ok then
[20:05] <@Mino> apt-get upgrade does the actually upgrading
[20:05] <mattiZed> apt-get upgrade is a different story though
[20:05] <mattiZed> right
[20:05] <@Mino> update just refreshes the packages in the repos
[20:05] <@Mino> so just restore the old sources.list and do another apt-get update and it's back to normal
[20:07] <PerpetualWar_> ok
[20:09] <mattiZed> does anybody know if win 10 is now able to create a bootable usb stick from an iso file right out of the box?
[20:10] <mattiZed> so far i really like that OS but i  still doubt it can do things like that :D
[20:15] <Fraggan> hmm WTF!
[20:15] <Fraggan> Isnt there a standalone server to download and install?
[20:15] <Fraggan> Do I have to do it trough steam? Cant find it
[20:16] <@Mino> It is done through Steam, yeah
[20:16] <@Mino> and it is standalone
[20:16] <@Mino> but it's not like you need to load the GUI or anything
[20:16] <@Mino> just use steamcmd
[20:17] <Fraggan> So i have to donwload and install steam to my linuxserver?
[20:17] <Fraggan> Or is there a folder i can copy?
[20:18] <@Mino> steamcmd
[20:18] <@Mino> look it up
[20:18] <Fraggan> ok
[20:18] <Fraggan> i dont like this steam shit :D
[20:18] <Fraggan> Mino: what hw are u using to run ur server?
[20:19] <Fraggan> and internet?
[20:19] <Fraggan> So I have somethjing to go on when deploying my server through vmware
[20:19] <tjone270> mkdir ~/steamcmd; cd ~/steamcmd; wget https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz; tar -xvzf steamcmd_linux.tar.gz; rm steamcmd_linux.tar.gz
[20:20] <tjone270> one liner to install steamcmd
[20:20] <tjone270> ./steamcmd.sh +login anonymous +force_install_dir ~/steamcmd/steamapps/common/qlds/ +app_update 349090 +quit
[20:20] <tjone270> one liner to install QLDS
[20:22] <Gelenkbus> "The current fun plugin is still just sitting on my local disk. I need to make some changes to it before it goes live." pls do :) Cant await to have our old fun plugins working  
02[20:23] * Thaya (~x@Aqila.users.quakenet.org) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:24] <mattiZed> Fraggan, i think steam is very good for QL and the community as a whole, tbh
[20:25] <Gelenkbus> hi matti
[20:26] <Gelenkbus> that topdog.io stuff, is this something serious which will grow to the new standard?
[20:26] <mattiZed> hey mr busfahrer
[20:26] <mattiZed> hmm maybe
[20:26] <mattiZed> hope so
[20:26] <mattiZed> inl is doing it
[20:26] <Gelenkbus> inl?
[20:26] <mattiZed> he's working on a website right now, i think
[20:27] <Gelenkbus> oh kk
[20:27] <Gelenkbus> got my minqlx bot installed today :D
[20:27] <Gelenkbus> yay
[20:27] <PerpetualWar_> Mino
[20:27] <PerpetualWar_> have probs
[20:28] <Gelenkbus> not that trivial if you're not familiar with linux
[20:28] <PerpetualWar_> 1064 linux-x64 Oct 30 2015 17:10:27
[20:28] <PerpetualWar_> [minqlx] Initializing...
[20:28] <PerpetualWar_> [minqlx] Initializing Python...
[20:28] <PerpetualWar_> [minqlx] Python initialization failed: 2
[20:28] <PerpetualWar_> from supervisor log
[20:31] <PerpetualWar_> hm ok that was my bad
[20:31] <PerpetualWar_> forgot one moreline to install
[20:35] <PerpetualWar_> !myperm shows 0 even though I have set qlx_owner <steamid> in server.cfg ?
[20:36] <PerpetualWar_> any ideaS?
[20:38] <PerpetualWar_> my bad again
[20:39] <PerpetualWar_> ok working
[20:39] <PerpetualWar_> how can I change that info which is on map load ?
[20:41] <@Mino> nOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN
[20:41] <@Mino> caps
[20:42] <mattiZed> that is in _core.py
[20:42] <mattiZed> search for set_map_subtitles() function
[20:43] <mattiZed> you will have to unzip minqlx.zip, if you use the archive
[20:43] <mattiZed> and rezip again, if you want to keep it
[20:43] <Gelenkbus> question regarding sound/vo/crash_new/37b_07_alt.wav in motd.py ... is this a directory within qlds?
[20:43] <@Mino> You should be doing that using a plugin, not by modifying the core module
[20:43] <@Mino> No, that's in pak00.pk3
[20:43] <Gelenkbus> ah k
[20:44] <mattiZed> ah well, i change the right in the core module
[20:44] <PerpetualWar_> how to do that Mino ?
[20:44] <Gelenkbus> it plays the sound only if motd is activated, right?
[20:44] <PerpetualWar_> what plugin ?
[20:44] <@Mino> A new one
[20:44] <PerpetualWar_> not published yet ?
[20:45] <@Mino> What I mean is you should be using your own plugin to do that
[20:45] <Gelenkbus> ah no sry ..think i just set vo volume to 0
[20:45] <@Mino> It'll persist upgrades and doesn't fuck up the whole thing if you mess something else up
[20:45] <mattiZed> thats right though
[20:45] <mattiZed> :D
[20:45] <PerpetualWar_> I lost ya
[20:46] <PerpetualWar_> I need to code my own plugin to do that ?
[20:46] <PerpetualWar_> to change info ?
[20:46] <@Mino> If you're talking about the stuff under the map name in the loading screen, then yes, that's the recommended way of doing it.
[20:46] <mattiZed> you will have to set configstrings 3, 678 and 679
[20:47] <PerpetualWar_> ye on map load
[20:47] <mattiZed> have  a look into the code how mino does it and write a plugin from that
[20:47] <PerpetualWar_> heh
[20:47] <mattiZed> def set_map_subtitles():
[20:47] <mattiZed>     minqlx.set_configstring(678, "Running minqlx ^6{}^7 with plugins ^6{}^7."
[20:47] <mattiZed>         .format(minqlx.__version__, minqlx.__plugins_version__))
[20:47] <mattiZed>     minqlx.set_configstring(679, "Check ^6http://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx^7 for more details.")
[20:47] <PerpetualWar_> would be nice to be able to do that
[20:47] <PerpetualWar_> unfortunatly Im not
[20:47] <mattiZed> cmon perpy
[20:47] <mattiZed> do some research :D
[20:47] <PerpetualWar_> :D
[20:48] <mattiZed> well mino, what event would you hook eventually?
[20:48] <@Mino> "new_game"
[20:48] <mattiZed> i remember that there was a problem with load_map
[20:48] <mattiZed> ah right, that exists? nice
[20:48] <PerpetualWar_> maybe tjone270 will write that plugin :D
[20:48] <@Mino> Yeah, "new_game" will be called right after set_map_subtitles() is set
[20:49] <mattiZed> well perp, have  a look into essentials.py for example
[20:49] <mattiZed> there are some hooks in there, what functions they call you can easily find out
[20:49] <mattiZed> and then go from there
[20:49] <tjone270> perp: I'll supply you with a plugin that does it
[20:49] <PerpetualWar_> awesome tjone270
[20:49] <PerpetualWar_> :D
[20:51] <mattiZed> ^^
[20:51] <tjone270> stripping down my version now
[20:53] <mattiZed> maybe i should write one to
[20:53] <mattiZed> so i can skip fixing the _core.py every time, heh
[20:54] <tjone270> https://gist.github.com/tjone270/1b7a3ffc5874558a9362
[20:54] <tjone270> easy-to-use
[20:54] <mattiZed> yep, well done
[20:55] <PerpetualWar_> :D
[20:55] <PerpetualWar_> nice
[20:55] <PerpetualWar_> thanks tjone270 ;)
[20:56] <PerpetualWar_> question TB`oFF|AsianEye
[20:56] <PerpetualWar_> question tjone270
[20:56] <tjone270> sure
[20:56] <PerpetualWar_> can it be used on per server basis ?
[20:56] <PerpetualWar_> uhm per port ?
[20:57] <tjone270> yes
[20:57] <PerpetualWar_> for exmaple I want different text for 27960
[20:57] <tjone270> make multiple plugins
[20:57] <PerpetualWar_> and 27962
[20:57] <tjone270> or
[20:57] <tjone270> have the plugin check the fs.homepath
[20:57] <tjone270> and do differently according to the homepath
[20:57] <PerpetualWar_> ok so it check fs_homepath and reads from there
[20:57] <tjone270> `no
[20:58] <tjone270> I can have it check the fs_homepath cvar
[20:58] <mattiZed> not yet, heh
[20:58] <tjone270> and if fs_homepath = "../../27960"
[20:58] <mattiZed> but you can easily use get_cvar() for that
[20:58] <tjone270> then do these configstrings, else to some other one
[20:58] <tjone270> yes
[20:58] <mattiZed> its not that hard, perp :>
[20:59] <PerpetualWar_> lol
[20:59] <mattiZed> you could even introduce cvar's for that
[20:59] <mattiZed> and set the brandings via cfg
[20:59] <mattiZed> or launchscript
[20:59] <mattiZed> or or or
[20:59] <mattiZed> :D
[20:59] <tjone270> yes, qlx_brandName, qlx_topMessage, qlx_bottomMessage
[21:00] <mattiZed> i got no time now, but i might do that tomorrow
[21:00] <mattiZed> or tjone's gonna do that now, if he gets bored, heh
[21:00] <tjone270> I should prob do that now
[21:00] <PerpetualWar_> you should !
[21:00] <PerpetualWar_> if you can
[21:00] <tjone270> lol
[21:00] <PerpetualWar_> :D
[21:00] <tjone270> okay, give me a second
[21:00] <PerpetualWar_> :D
[21:00] <mattiZed> you're not a good teacher, tjone270 
[21:00] <mattiZed> :D:D
[21:00] <tjone270> I know
[21:01] <tjone270> that's why people like me
[21:01] <tjone270> :D
[21:01] <mattiZed> you make people go lazy :D
[21:01] <mattiZed> hah
[21:01] <tjone270> I know :D I learn in the process of robbing people of the opportunity to learn
[21:01] <mattiZed> but for real, perp. if you feel like it sometimes, have a look at the files and try to get a glimpse what they're doing
[21:01] <mattiZed> if you run into questions then, feel free to ask again
[21:01] <mattiZed> its always good to learn
[21:02] <mattiZed> haha tjone270, i know what you mean :p
[21:02] <tjone270> mattiZed's right :D
[21:02] <mattiZed> kinda the same to me
[21:02] <mattiZed> i ran a good bunch of people through the server-setup-process
[21:02] <mattiZed> in query
[21:02] <mattiZed> :D
[21:03] <tjone270> `good :D
[21:03] <tjone270> plan on making a script for it
[21:03] <PerpetualWar_> well I already lookoed in essentials.py
[21:03] <mattiZed> well, you kinda did that already
02[21:03] * kanzo (~kanzo@kanzo.users.quakenet.org) Quit (Signed off)
[21:03] <PerpetualWar_> but Im not making much of it tbh
[21:03] <tjone270> yes, but also minqlx install
[21:03] <mattiZed> but thats just little helpers - you're shooting for a more userfriendly kind of thing?
[21:04] <tjone270> Eventually
[21:04] <tjone270> one script 
[21:04] <tjone270> with numbered options
[21:04] <tjone270> like Install everything
[21:04] <tjone270> install just this
[21:04] <tjone270> update just that
[21:04] <tjone270> kill everybody
[21:04] <tjone270> etc
[21:04] <mattiZed> well perp, first comes the initialization. and you add either hooks (which trigger when certain events happen, like vote_called) or commands
[21:04] <mattiZed> commands trigger when some guy issues them, obviously
[21:05] <mattiZed> and that add_hook( ) think would tell the plugin on the last argument what the plugin should to then
[21:05] <mattiZed> basically a function call to self.brand_map for example
[21:05] <mattiZed> and in that function you do your stuff
[21:06] <mattiZed> once the function is done, the hook or command was processed
[21:06] <mattiZed> and thats it, basically
[21:06] <mattiZed> of course there is more to it, but that kinda is the basis
[21:06] <PerpetualWar_> add_hook() is defined where ?
[21:06] <mattiZed> *base
[21:06] <mattiZed> in the core module
[21:06] <mattiZed> some where
[21:06] <mattiZed> :D
[21:07] <mattiZed> could look that up now, but gtg
[21:07] <PerpetualWar_> ye but how would you know it exist ? :D
[21:07] <PerpetualWar_> there is no doc
[21:07] <PerpetualWar_> for this right ? :D
[21:07] <mattiZed> because the plugins you can already look at are using it frequently...
[21:07] <mattiZed> they work, right?
[21:07] <mattiZed> :D
[21:07] <PerpetualWar_> oh ok
[21:08] <mattiZed> if i had to take a guess, i'd say it is in here
[21:08] <mattiZed> https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx/blob/master/python/minqlx/_plugin.py
[21:08] <mattiZed> yeah, search for add_hook( in that file :p
[21:08] <@Mino> Yup, all the methods are there
[21:08] <mattiZed> bb
