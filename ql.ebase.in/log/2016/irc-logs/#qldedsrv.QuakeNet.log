[20:30] <lonewulf_> Going through quakelive.focus log (Steam release time) .. read this and LOL
[20:30] <lonewulf_> 18:13 8/<g gPredatH0rg8/>g emy windows server is running the whole day without issues so far
[20:30] * Rick971_ has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:31] <lonewulf_> This was around the time of all the Linux qlds crashes.
[20:31] * Rick971_ has joined #qldedsrv
[20:31] <lonewulf_> heh
[20:31] <vtchill> anyone know of documentation describing every config var that can be set in either server.cfg or on the exec line (e.g. +set fs_homepath)
[20:32] <lonewulf_> I wish..that would be gold.
[20:33] <McAfee> we need to turn sponge into a singularity, then we will have all the knowledge xD
[20:33] <lonewulf_> lol
[20:34] <McAfee> but this is a start: http://www.regurge.at/ql/
[20:34] <McAfee> http://www.holysh1t.net/quake-live-commands-list/
[20:34] <sponge-> listcvars *
[20:35] <sponge-> but there's just a lot of shit that was in q3 and doesn't do anything in ql
[20:35] * Oh`Christ`Off is now known as Oh`Christ
[20:35] <vtchill> yea exactly, i just want to know what is relative to the server config without everything else
[20:35] <lonewulf_> terminal history too short for listcvars*
[20:35] <vtchill> especially without all the cvars that do nothing
[20:35] <McAfee> didnt the wolfet version of listcvars and listcmds have comments in the output ?
[20:35] <sponge-> look at g_, pmove_, weapon_, and sv_
[20:35] <vtchill> any easy way to print this list out from console/
[20:36] <sponge-> logfile 2
[20:36] <sponge-> and then run the cmd
[20:36] <McAfee> you could also run the command 26 times: listcvars a*    .... listcvars z*
[20:37] <lonewulf_> Thats what I did the other night ^^
[20:38] <McAfee> but yeah i think wolfet, or either etqw, had comments when outputing cvars
[20:38] <sponge-> that was tech 4
[20:38] <McAfee> :)
[20:38] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[20:40] <sponge-> when it comes down to it i dont even know what all the cvars do and its not even apparent in the code sometimes
[20:40] <sponge-> and then theres stuff like disable_* which aren't registered cvars at all
[20:41] <McAfee> yeah but if we turn you into a singularity, there's stuff you know that you are not aware you know :P
[20:41] <lonewulf_> we may never know all the definitions to listcvars* :((
[20:43] <lonewulf_> quake is the most mysterious game ever.
[20:43] * Rick971_ has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[20:45] <McAfee> Was it ALL Carmack as far as cvars go back then quake3 was released?
[20:46] <McAfee> when*
[20:47] <McAfee> and John Cash, accoridng to the credits... don't think i remember him
[20:50] <roast> i remember johnny cash
[20:51] <McAfee> http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1063/
[20:52] <Drayan> that's quite a CV
[20:55] <lonewulf_> High pings today on servers
[20:55] * lonewulf_ wonders if its only him
[20:55] <lonewulf_> time too restart vps I suppose.

[22:42] <lonewulf> My ping to my Chicago servers (this has been like this all day so far) have gone from 30 ping to 130ping
[22:42] <lonewulf> for me.
[22:42] <lonewulf> would this be an issue w/my vps, or my actual isp?
[22:42] <lonewulf> my isp right?
[22:43] <carmethene> traceroute it?
[22:43] <lonewulf> trying to figure out who to contact, my isp, or the vps Im using for qlds.
[22:43] <carmethene> traceroute it
[22:43] <lonewulf> kk
[22:43] <lonewulf> thanks
[22:43] <carmethene> hopefully you will see the ping jump suddenly during one of the hops
[22:44] <carmethene> or maybe you'll just see your packets taking a ridiculous route
[22:44] <lonewulf> I think its on my end (my isp).. because all the low ping servers that I would normally connect too, are now well over a 100 ping.
[22:44] <lonewulf> let me google traceroute
[22:44] <lonewulf> xD
[22:44] <carmethene> sounds that way, but traceroute will give you more concrete info
[22:44] <carmethene> are you on windows or linux?
[22:45] <carmethene> I'm guessing the former?
[22:45] <lonewulf> kk thank you sir
[22:45] <carmethene> open cmd.exe, tracert www.google.com
[22:45] <carmethene> or such
[22:45] <lonewulf> kk
[22:45] <lonewulf> currently on win7
[22:45] <lonewulf> using PuTTY
[22:45] <lonewulf> lol
[22:45] <carmethene> nothing wrong with that
[22:45] * crobartie has quit IRC (Signed off)
[22:45] <lonewulf> but I play from win7, so yeah.
[22:46] <lonewulf> I prefer to be in my Arch Linux install tho
[22:46] <lonewulf> :D
[22:46] <carmethene> I'm stuck in Windows land too
[22:46] <carmethene> Cygwin to the rescue
[22:46] <lonewulf> but no Linux client for ql.
[22:46] <lonewulf> lol
[22:46] <lonewulf> cool
[22:46] <lonewulf> I've used Cygwin before.
[22:46] <carmethene> mostly Cygwin or Chrome Mosh to my Debian workstation
[22:47] <lonewulf> Very nice!
[22:47] <carmethene> it's a great compromise :)
[22:47] <carmethene> just need to figure out how to get PulseAudio working over SSH and I'm done
[22:49] <lonewulf> gl with that.
[22:50] <lonewulf> thought I had notes on that..
[22:50] <lonewulf> just checked, and was about 
[22:50] <lonewulf> scp
[22:50] <lonewulf> # Copy files from a remote server to your local computer.
[22:50] <lonewulf> That wont help you any ^
[22:50] <lonewulf> :o
[22:51] <carmethene> ah I know roughly how to do it, just need to sit down and figure out the details
[22:51] <lonewulf> ah, the fun part!
[22:51] <lonewulf> :D
[22:51] <carmethene> you can expose the audio hardware as a port
[22:52] <carmethene> then on the remote client, you point at the port, et voila, remote audio, just like remote X
[22:52] <carmethene> but obviously you don't want your audio hardware sitting open on the network, so there's some ssh tunnelling involved, etc
[22:52] <carmethene> anyhow, any luck with the traceroute?
[22:52] <lonewulf> trying now
[22:54] <lonewulf> 'traceroute' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
[22:54] <lonewulf> operable program or batch file.
[22:54] <lonewulf> stupid windows command prompt.
[22:54] <Drayan> tracert
[22:54] <lonewulf> kk ty
[22:55] <carmethene> 11:45 < carmethene> open cmd.exe, tracert www.google.com
[22:55] <lonewulf> I put my actual ip to my qlds in.
[22:55] <lonewulf> :o
[22:55] <carmethene> even bettr
[22:56] <lonewulf> Trace complete.
[22:56] <carmethene> anything obvious with the timings?
[22:57] <lonewulf> goes from 1 ms to 17 to 30 to 127
[22:57] <carmethene> that last one sounds pretty egregious
[22:57] <carmethene> try some other sites, find a pattern
[22:57] <carmethene> see if you can identify a specific hop where it goes up
[22:57] <carmethene> that should tell you who you need to contact
[22:57] <lonewulf> kk
[22:57] <carmethene> if it's right at the start, it's your local network
[22:57] <carmethene> just outside that, your ISP
[22:58] <lonewulf> over a maximum of 30 hops:
[22:58] <carmethene> on the far end, it's probably the target machine
[22:58] <lonewulf> its says.
[22:58] <carmethene> etc
[22:58] <carmethene> also doing a few passes helps
[22:58] <lonewulf> Roger that~
[22:58] <carmethene> sometimes the large hop is temporary
[22:58] <lonewulf> kk
[22:58] <carmethene> e.g. 4,5,3,4,5,2000,2,4
[22:59] <carmethene> which implies some amount of packet loss, or routing insanity
[22:59] <lonewulf> its my isp
[22:59] <carmethene> I had a case where the spike was moving around all over the traceroute
[22:59] <lonewulf> the 127 jump is in a town very close to me
[22:59] <carmethene> turned out to be faulty hardware right outside the house
[22:59] <lonewulf> very close = a couple miles away.
[22:59] <carmethene> there you go then
[23:00] <lonewulf> :D
[23:00] <carmethene> what's your server ip btw?
[23:00] <carmethene> I'll tell you what I'm pinging to it
[23:00] <lonewulf> 45.63.70.118:27960-2
[23:00] <lonewulf> Im running 3 duel servers
[23:00] <lonewulf> classic
[23:00] <carmethene> steady 80ms-ish
[23:01] <lonewulf> is that good for you?
[23:01] <lonewulf> server is in Chicago
[23:01] <carmethene> for Chicago?  Yeah I guess so
[23:01] <carmethene> I'm in San Francisco
[23:01] <lonewulf> kk cool
[23:01] <lonewulf> ah
[23:01] <lonewulf> thats great for you then
[23:01] <lonewulf> :p
[23:02] <carmethene> :)
[23:02] <lonewulf> well, calling the ISP
[23:02] <lonewulf> Maybe I'll get lucky and get a gamer tech help person.. and he/she will give me better routing around the World.!
[23:02] <lonewulf> :))
[23:03] <carmethene> heh
[23:03] <carmethene> it happens
[23:03] <carmethene> our local Comcast office is amazeballs
[23:03] <lonewulf> :o
[23:04] <[ByQ]Descent> try us-1.ql.ebase.in - its in Chicago too...
[23:04] <carmethene> me or him?
[23:05] <lonewulf> I usually ping low 20s there [ByQ]Descent.
[23:05] <lonewulf> its well over a 100 as well.
[23:05] <carmethene> high 80s
[23:05] <carmethene> much the same as lonewulf's
[23:05] * vtchill has quit IRC (Signed off)
[23:05] <lonewulf> :D
[23:06] <[ByQ]Descent> traceroute ...
[23:06] <[ByQ]Descent> linux: top
[23:06] <lonewulf> I was in Steam Server Browser when I noticed the hight pings to Chicago. (was like this server browser sucks)
[23:07] <lonewulf> s/hight/high
[23:09] <lonewulf> Not! Its my ISP that sucks!
[23:09] <lonewulf> heh
[23:10] <roast> have you tried closing your goat porn torrents
[23:10] <[ByQ]Descent> ..for sure it helps ..
[23:11] <lonewulf> lol
[23:11] <lonewulf> I dont torrent
[23:11] <roast> close your goat porn usenet downloads
[23:12] <lonewulf> lol
[23:13] <[ByQ]Descent> :D
[23:15] <lonewulf> Just glad its on my end (ISP)
[23:16] <lonewulf> knowing that I can leave my servers up
[23:16] <lonewulf> would have hated a regular user joined and had horrible ping. (they might not reconnect in the future)
[23:16] <lonewulf> :D
[23:16] <lonewulf> had it been vultr.com (vps Im using)
[23:17] <lonewulf> Im watching them like a hawk..
[23:18] <[ByQ]Descent> other users have ping issues or not?
[23:18] <lonewulf> Also, found a way to install Arch GNU/Linux on DO now too.
[23:18] <lonewulf> :D

[23:28] <McAfee> fyi @ traceroute, some servers ignore ICMP, others reply with a lower priority, so some hops will always report a high ping, but the next hop is normal again.
[23:29] <McAfee> you did sort of cover it when you said it was temporary
[23:30] <McAfee> but it's more like permanently configured to not give a good reply.

[00:39] <tjone270_> g_voteFlags 8 is the cvar that will disable that. 
[00:40] <NOR> ok, tryed that i server.cfg but I could still vote .. But i'm admin :) ?
[00:40] <tjone270_> You'll also need to make sure your map-pool doesn't contain modes outside of the ones you'd like to run.
[00:40] <tjone270_> Admins bypass vote flags.

[00:59] <tjone270_> Ahoy :)
[00:59] <NOR> Some tips / hints about running the run_xxx as an daemon or...
[01:00] <NOR> screen is not the way :S but..
[01:00] <NOR> ?
[01:00] <tjone270_> to run it daemonised, you'll need to either suspend and background the process, (and disown if you want to exit the remote shell, if it's remote).
[01:01] <NOR> mm, command example?
[01:01] <tjone270_> You can also start the process with nohup, and end the line with & to daemonise it. 
[01:01] <tjone270_> ./quakestart.sh & disown %1
[01:01] <tjone270_> or 
[01:02] <tjone270_> nohup ./quakestart.sh &
[01:02] <tjone270_> or use supervisor
[01:02] <NOR> should I su as "user" before running ?
[01:03] <tjone270_> indeed
[01:03] <NOR> :)
[01:03] <NOR> Ok, I've seen the bash script for launching multiple servers, but how about starting at server startup
[01:04] <NOR> ?
[01:04] <tjone270_> as in if the linux server itself has been down, and to start the quake process on boot?
[01:04] <vtchill> just run supervisor and have something like upstart start supervisor at boot
[01:05] <vtchill> thats the way i run it
[01:05] <NOR> ues tjone270_
[01:05] <NOR> yes*
[01:05] <vtchill> that way cyclig the box auto runs the qlds servers 
[01:05] <vtchill> and supervisor will auto restart if one qlds instance crashes while the box is still running
[01:05] <NOR> Ok
[01:05] <tjone270_> what vtchill says will work, or you could whack in a small sudo -u "user" /path/to/script & disown %1
[01:06] <tjone270_> to rc.local

[02:09] <snipe> lonewulf: just remember that in tracerotue a single hop reporting random latency isn't a problem unless the following ups also incur the same latency issue
[02:09] <snipe> eg if there is an increse of 50ms on hop 3 then hop4, hop5, hop6 etc all would have an increase of 50ms if the issue is hop 3
[02:10] <snipe> otherwise it is just icmp rate limiting on the router or switch cpu to protect from dos
[02:10] <snipe> ugh cant type, isn't a problem unless the following hops** also incur the same latency issue
[02:12] <snipe> also if it is your ISP they are not likely todo anything for you unless you are paying for a dedicated circuit which has SLA guarantees

[02:41] <carmethene> snipe: a sudden jump in ping implies a technical issue though
[02:42] <carmethene> if there's a legitimate fault in the line, the ISP should help out
[02:42] <carmethene> but yeah that's good advice re timings
[02:50] <lonewulf> snipe: Appreciate the response. I pretty much understand what you're telling me.
[02:51] <lonewulf> I called my ISP and they are claiming, no packet loss, so no problem.. Currently chatting w/VULTR (vps Im using for qlds)
[02:54] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[02:55] <lonewulf> but tracert shows me leaving my Asus router, 2nd line says * Request timed out. The next 5 hops are all my ISP (ping times in the 20s), then it jumps to 130 ping in the Town my ISP is in.. the next 10 hops or so are all 120 - 150 ping until I get to my qlds ip.
[02:56] <lonewulf> ^^ Thats what made me think the issue was w/my ISP. cause it happens so early in the tracert.
[02:57] <lonewulf> basically the qlds I spawned in Chicago, I USED to get 30-39 ping..and all morning/day long pings times at my Chicago have been 120+ ping.

[02:59] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:59] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[03:01] <lonewulf> I think it almost has to be my ISP..simply because all the other qlds server I USED to ping 20-40 are all now well over 100 ping for me.
[03:03] <lonewulf> Unless those servers are using vultr vps as well.. what are the odds tho?

[03:39] * Rick971_ has joined #qldedsrv
[03:40] <snipe> carmethene: it doesnt suggest anything other than RTT increased
[03:42] <snipe> reasons why can be line/fabric between hop2->hop3 saturated, QoS of ICMP only not udp/tcp, control plane of hop3 saturated(doesnt always increase RTT for tcp/udp), rate limiting of ICMP
[03:42] <snipe> many other possibilities
[03:43] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[03:43] <snipe> it not directly linked to being an issue unless it persists to the subsequent hops
[03:44] <snipe> it is not*
[03:45] <snipe> lonewulf: run winmtr if you are on windows else mtr on linux... it will be a continuous trace
[03:46] <snipe> if you see a jump to 130 in the same town and all the following hops are >=130 then that is the issue
[03:46] <snipe> if subquent hops are <=130 then it is not the issue
[03:47] <snipe> sorry i just cannot type today
[03:47] <snipe> the * * * just indicates rules which are blocking icmp
[03:47] <snipe> in your case.
[03:51] <snipe> carmethene: typically the issue is overselling by the ISP, they often will not help you with that (it is how they make more money) and you will only know by speaking maybe 2-3 levels up from initial phone support
[03:52] <carmethene> interesting
[03:52] <carmethene> I guess I just got lucky then
[03:53] <carmethene> snipe: I did not know about mtr, thanks, that's a neat little tool
[03:54] <snipe> typically if you spend 600$+ then you have an in-network/provider latency commitment in which they will work with you
[03:54] <carmethene> I'm not a network guy - did a lot of this for my degree but I've since forgotten it all

[04:04] <lonewulf> :)
[04:05] <lonewulf> so problem is on there (VULTR) end?
[04:05] <snipe> both directions as the return path from the server may go over different routes
[04:05] <lonewulf> If they are having network engineers looking into it.
[04:05] <snipe> past them both in pastebin.com and link me
[04:05] <snipe> paste/
[04:05] <snipe> X out the end IPs if you want

[04:05] <lonewulf> I was just thinking like this guy isnt going to DDOS me is he?
[04:05] <lonewulf> :p

[04:06] <lonewulf> gotcha
[04:06] <snipe> i havent ddosd anyone in 12 yrs :|
[04:06] <lonewulf> :D
[04:07] <lonewulf> snipe: hold on man..the networking engineer just got back w/me.. they say its my ISP and they are known for doing this.
[04:07] <lonewulf> wtf!?!
[04:07] <snipe> what isp?
[04:08] <snipe> he might just be speaking in general
[04:08] <snipe> but curious
[04:11] <carmethene> that's great customer service from your vps provider
[04:11] <carmethene> well above and beyond
[04:12] <lonewulf> snipe: I'll pastebin what he/she just typed too me..please dont attack me. (DDOS)
[04:12] <lonewulf> shit is crazy
[04:12] <lonewulf> its my ISP
[04:12] <lonewulf> like I orginally thought.
[04:13] <lonewulf> I mean shit, ping jumps up at my ISP and stay hight all the way to VULTR.
[04:13] <snipe> justX out your ips :P
[04:13] <lonewulf> kk
[04:13] <snipe> keep other hop ips
[04:14] <snipe> so right it sounds like isp, im curious about the return route too thou
[04:14] <lonewulf> snipe: I dont see any sensitive info here. (besides my vps qlds ip)
[04:15] <snipe> x that out if you want
[04:15] <lonewulf> snipe: sent in pm.
[04:15] <lonewulf> let me know what you think.
[04:15] <lonewulf> my ISP basically pulled a fast one on me.
[04:16] <lonewulf> routing me shitty intentionally.
[04:16] <lonewulf> crazy man.
[04:16] <carmethene> can you change ISP?
[04:16] <lonewulf> sure
[04:17] <lonewulf> Im not happy w/this cable internet anyways. It shitty.

[04:17] <carmethene> bastards

[04:24] <lonewulf> ah
[04:24] <carmethene> what I'm curious about is why it suddenly got worse
[04:24] <lonewulf> right
[04:25] <carmethene> maybe you could work around it with wtfast or such?
[04:25] <lonewulf> I heard wtfast is fake
[04:25] <lonewulf> not real
[04:25] <lonewulf> only ppl getting sponsor money from them tell ppl wtfast will reduce ping times.

[05:23] <lonewulf> snipe: 
[05:23] <lonewulf> MTR running on my ISP IP
[05:23] <lonewulf> is just a one-liner

[06:18] <m1dnight> What protocols does the server use? tcp or udp? (for server and rcon)
[06:18] <m1dnight> I have opened both atm, but its probably only one of both?
[06:22] <tjone270_> UDP for server
[06:22] <tjone270_> TCP for RCON, iirc
[06:24] <tjone270_> most likely tcp for stats also, but unsure.
[06:25] <m1dnight> hmmm,thats something Im unaware of
[06:25] <m1dnight> oh stats runs on the gameport
[06:25] <m1dnight> so that makes sense
[06:25] <tjone270_> :)
[06:25] <m1dnight> so just tcp for rcon then
[06:25] <m1dnight> thanks tjone270_
[06:25] <tjone270_> pretty sure :) welcome
[06:25] <m1dnight> lets see if this thing runs on an atom.. :>
[06:26] <tjone270_> def will
[06:26] <m1dnight> good. Its on a home connection, but a 250/20 mbit connection
[06:26] <m1dnight> so im guessing that wil do just fine.

[17:53] <roasticle> easiest way to monitor a bunch of servers is open a steam server info window for each hah
[17:53] <roasticle> they refresh stats automatically
[17:54] <m1dnight> how do you do that?
[17:54] <roasticle> as far as just looking at maps/player activity
[17:54] * m1dnight is new to all the steam stuff
[17:54] <roasticle> find your server in steam right click show server info
[17:54] <roasticle> you can do that for multiple servers and it opens a window for each
[17:55] <m1dnight> oh like that :D
[17:55] <m1dnight> Eh, quake doesnt run properly here. Cba to fix it.
[17:55] <m1dnight> Im just the serverguy :>
[17:57] <roasticle> these windows will tell you if server is not responding as well

[18:16] <m1dnight> where does one put the qlserver.cfg files?
[18:16] <m1dnight> I see that .quakelive/serverport/baseq3 is in the searchpath
[18:16] <m1dnight> but i think thats the one that gets overwritten, right?
[18:23] <roasticle> if you are setting seperate fs_basepath's they wont get overwritten
[18:23] <m1dnight> ah that would be another flag to the binary then
[18:23] <m1dnight> lemme see
[18:23] <m1dnight> (small note: ^C doesnt work to stop a server? I have to sigkill it?)
[18:33] <Drayan> does for me
[18:33] <m1dnight> odd
[18:33] <Drayan> might be because I set ttycon to 0
[18:33] <m1dnight> oh wait, might be because im running it through a script
[18:34] <m1dnight> but i dont think so, though

[20:25] <m1dnight> Drayan: how do you set the ttycon?
[20:25] <m1dnight> Is it an argument to the binary?
[20:27] <Drayan> +set ttycon 0
[20:27] <Drayan> yes

[20:41] <m1dnight> is there a manpage or something for that binary, btw?
[20:42] <m1dnight> the manual says "you can add commandline options at will" thats nice, but which ones are there :>
[20:42] <vtchill> asked this yesterday, sponge suggesting looking at /listcvars command and also looking at g_, sv_, etc. commands from console
[20:43] <vtchill> no manual
[20:43] <m1dnight> oh
[20:43] <m1dnight> oh basically they are qlserver.cfg commands
[20:43] <m1dnight> that explains a lot
[20:43] <m1dnight> I thought they were specific to the binary
[20:43] <vtchill> yea basically
[20:44] <vtchill> i think it just passes them through to the qlds for parsing
[20:44] <lonewulfn6> logfile 0
[20:45] <lonewulfn6> then command
[20:45] <lonewulfn6> will output to txt file
[20:45] <vtchill> what does the number after logfile mean?
[20:45] <lonewulfn6> not sure
[20:47] * mikul is now known as mikul|afk
[20:53] <m1dnight> hmm ^C still doesnt work
[20:53] <m1dnight> strange
[20:56] <m1dnight> in htop I do can see that the ttycon optoin is not in the flaglist
[20:56] <m1dnight> so perhaps a syntax error
[21:35] <McAfee> number after logfile means, bufferd or unbuffered writes, afaik
[21:36] <McAfee> if you have a crash situation that is not a graceful crash, you dont want buffered writes

[17:45] <Drayan> yes
[17:45] <Drayan> if you want to add you do something.factories
[17:45] <PaasHaas> ah kk
[17:46] <PaasHaas> how to load the file then?
[17:46] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[17:46] <Drayan> it's automatic
[17:46] <PaasHaas> huh
[17:46] <McAfee> automagical :P

[17:46] <PaasHaas> ahhh
[17:46] <PaasHaas> kk
[17:47] <PaasHaas> will try thx :)
[17:47] <PaasHaas> one more question
[17:47] <PaasHaas> added workshops in the workshop file...but it downloads everytime @ serverstart
[17:47] <Drayan> are you launching qzeroded from the same folder each time?
[17:48] <PaasHaas> yea
[17:48] <Drayan> as in, your current working directory
[17:48] <Drayan> not the file location
[17:48] <PaasHaas> ill try
[17:48] <PaasHaas> thx
[17:49] <Drayan> I put a "cd ~/Steam/" in my launch script
[17:49] <Drayan> so workshop items always get saved relative to there
[17:50] <McAfee> hmm, i thought it would use the fshomepath
[17:50] <Drayan> nah
[17:50] <Drayan> maybe it should, I'm not sure what happens when you launch multiple servers at the same time and try to update the same workshop item simultaneously
[17:50] <Drayan> and it tries to update*
[17:51] <PaasHaas> oke...launch scrip starts with exec /home/steam blabla
[17:51] <McAfee> depends if it downloads to temp file and overwrite, or it writes in place
[17:51] <PaasHaas> need to cd first?
[17:51] <Drayan> I put cd before the qzeroded lines
[17:52] <PaasHaas> kk will try

[22:11] <m1dnight> Would DigitalOcean be a good provider for a quakeserver?
[22:11] <m1dnight> Before I buy a droplet
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> many use dig ocean for quake servers
[22:13] <m1dnight> cool. then ill buy one as well.
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> but some experience lags
[22:13] <m1dnight> First im going to try and debug the ping issues with my home server. Not sure why it gives high latency for people outside .be
[22:14] <PerpetualWar> you can also check host1plus
[22:20] <b1ngo> wait
[22:21] <b1ngo> all our pRophecy servers running at gamerzhost.de
[22:21] <b1ngo> check that out also

[19:38] <Hajen> Anyone know how to enable autodownload for a server ?
[19:42] <roasticle> i didnt have to enable anything when i added my workshop maps
[19:43] <tjone270> Auto-download is now irrelevant afaik
[19:43] <Drayan> Hajen: if your server has custom maps you should upload them to the workshop
[19:43] <Drayan> and yes, autodownload is dead
[19:43] <roasticle> ya downloads from workshop, not server
[19:44] <Hajen> ok, so if i have custom workshop maps installed in server the client shall get t he map automatically
[19:44] <Hajen> not a cvar to set in the server ?
[19:44] <Drayan> right
[19:45] <Hajen> It does not seem to work on my server. Any suggestion what might be wrong ?
[19:45] <Drayan> did you use workshop.txt?
[19:45] <Hajen> yes
[19:46] <Hajen> the server can change map, but im emediatly thrown out when not having the map/ra3map9.pl3
[19:47] <Hajen> the server does not seem to enable autodownload for the client for some reason
[19:47] <tjone270> the clients download the items via steam, so do the servers
[19:47] <Drayan> the only reason I can think of that happening is that you manually moved the ra3 map pk3 on your server
[19:47] <Drayan> to baseq3
[19:47] <tjone270> so no file transfer occurs from the server to the client
[19:47] <Drayan> maybe there's a clientside cvar for it
[19:47] <Hajen> exactly
[19:48] <Hajen> i just added the numbers to workshop.txt and the server downloaded the maps automatically when starting
[19:48] <tjone270> are you sure it didn't say "failed download" or similar
[19:48] <Hajen> yes
[19:49] <Hajen> they are present in the correct directories
[19:50] <tjone270> hmm
[19:50] <tjone270> weird then
[19:50] <Hajen> no additional port to open ?
[19:51] <tjone270> nope, as I say, no transfer between server+client regarding workshop maps
[19:51] <Hajen> but if the client is missing the map what happens
[19:51] <tjone270> server references a map to client, if client has map, load map, else request item download from steam, load map upon download completion
[19:51] <Hajen> AHA! then it must be a client issue
[19:51] <Hajen> :)
[19:52] <Hajen> ty
[19:52] <tjone270> not entirely necessarily
[19:52] <tjone270> try running https://github.com/tjone270/Quake-Live/blob/master/qlds-scripts/autodownload.sh
[19:53] <tjone270> I've had a similar issue that you've described
[19:53] <tjone270> that script will remove all workshop maps and re-download them externally from QLDS, which works better for me than QLDS download does
[19:54] <Hajen> ok now its running
[19:54] <tjone270> with my script or something else?
[19:55] <Hajen> yes
[19:55] <tjone270> well, which?
[19:55] <Hajen> after the autodownload completes ill try again and keep you posted
[19:55] <tjone270> oh, I see, thanks
[19:57] <Hajen> Im going to build an irc bot that fetches data from the server and analysis the data. Were are the server logs stored ?
[19:57] <tjone270> if you're running the server in supervisor, check out /tmp/qzeroded_*
[19:58] <tjone270> otherwise, might be in the fs_homepath
[19:58] <Hajen> using supervisor
[20:10] * crobartie has quit IRC (Signed off)
[20:12] <Hajen> Tried it again from client side. But first i removed the workshop folder in the client machine and tried to connect. It downloaded the map but the client culden't load the map
[20:13] <Hajen> I guess the the map is broken !?
[20:13] <Hajen> can this happen ?
[20:13] <tjone270> what map is it again
[20:13] <Hajen> ra3mapXY
[20:13] <QBall> its possible, people are are uploading all kinds of crap to the workshop atm :D
[20:13] <Hajen> XY = 1,2,6,9,...
[20:13] <Hajen> it worked yesterday
[20:13] <Hajen> ....
[20:14] <Hajen> quakelive updated.
[20:14] <tjone270> loaded ra3map13 just now, no problems
[20:14] <Hajen> did you connect from client ?
[20:15] <tjone270> yes

[20:16] <tjone270>  /connect brisbane.quakelive.tomtecsolutions.com.au:27960
[20:16] <Hajen> i got it to work
[20:17] <Hajen> ty for help
[20:17] <tjone270> you're welcome :)
[20:17] <Hajen> i think autodownload.sh solved it
[20:17] <Hajen> i have three servers running
[20:17] <tjone270> ah, good :D
[20:17] <Hajen> on two i updated the maps using your  scripts
[20:17] <Hajen> on the third i did not
[20:17] <Hajen> that one did not work
[20:17] <Hajen> but the others did
[20:17] <tjone270> I see
[20:18] <Hajen> :)
[20:18] <tjone270> that's good :D
[20:18] <Hajen> yes
[20:19] <tjone270> sponge-: if I set a cvar that doesn't exist in a factory, like "helloworld":"1", will it create the cvar, or fail and move on
[20:20] <sponge-> dunno! i think it will fail and move on
[20:20] <tjone270> okay, how does one create cvars?
[20:20] <sponge-> you can't
[20:21] <sponge-> you might be able to add it in server.cfg
[20:21] <sponge-> i dont know i never tried it
[20:21] <tjone270> okay, so like seta helloworld 1?
[20:21] <sponge-> yea
[20:21] <tjone270> I'm reading the listcmds 
[20:22] <tjone270> there's a cvaradd command and cvarmult command
[20:22] <tjone270> what're they for
[20:24] <tjone270> sponge-?
[20:24] <sponge-> cvaradd cg_fov -5
[20:24] <sponge-> reduces fov by 5 everytime you do it
[20:24] <tjone270> ah, I see, math functions

[22:21] <McAfee> ...i tested it, factories can create cvars

[22:42] <Drayan> you change gametype with the map command (or the callvote map command)
[22:42] <Drayan> callvote map ironworks ctf
[22:45] <Temppp> so using this "+set sv_mappoolFile "mappool_pqlffa.txt"" will make the server an ffa server?

[22:46] <Drayan> er
[22:46] <McAfee> assuming the file exists

[22:56] * vtchill has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[22:56] <[ByQ]Descent> +set basegt "ffa" \+set factory "ffa" \+set fraglimit 100 \+set sv_mapPoolFile = "mappool_ffa.txt" \
[22:58] * Oh`Christ is now known as Oh`Christ`Off
[22:58] <sponge-> what on earth
[22:58] <sponge-> just do +map campgrounds ffa
[22:58] <sponge-> those are not console cvars
[22:59] <sponge-> and you dont do = in +set either
[22:59] <sponge-> err sorry +map won't work on the cmdline, there's a cvar serverStartup in server.cfg or something, use that instead so it runs when the servers finishes loading
[22:59] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[23:00] <sponge-> but yea all you need to do to lock a server to a gametype is to add 8 to g_voteflags and use an appropriate mappool, thats it
[23:02] <McAfee> i don't understand the "Not follow the guide" mentality
[23:03] <[ByQ]Descent> .. setting multiple servers may be such unpredictable .. :D

[01:16] <lonewulf> Update: $5 Digital Ocean, $5 Vultr not enough really..
[01:17] <lonewulf> The Hitch warning(s): are real.
[01:17] <Drayan> how many servers?
[01:17] <[ByQ]Descent> what configuration?
[01:17] <lonewulf> 1
[01:17] <Drayan> eh
[01:17] <[ByQ]Descent> 1?
[01:17] <Drayan> x86 or x64?
[01:17] <kanzo> what
[01:17] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[01:18] <lonewulf> happens with one, or 3, or 10 instances..thats not the issue.
[01:18] <Drayan> i've yet to have a hitch
[01:18] <kanzo> bots?
[01:18] <lonewulf> no bots
[01:18] <lonewulf> single cpu is struggling.
[01:18] <lonewulf> tons of ppl have, and are complaining about it.
[01:19] <[ByQ]Descent> maybe its vps, its linux/qldedsrv configuration issues ..
[01:20] <lonewulf> tried both x86 and x64
[01:21] <[ByQ]Descent> lags or what?
[01:22] <lonewulf> Its a Hitch warning.
[01:22] <lonewulf> so yes, lag.
[01:23] <syncore> wat
[01:23] <lonewulf> Going to try 10 dollar USD Vultr, and DO.
[01:23] <syncore> i don't get that on my cheap digitalocean
[01:23] <lonewulf> hrmm
[01:23] <lonewulf> I dont get it all day everday..
[01:24] <lonewulf> but it does seem to happen everyday.
[01:24] <lonewulf> Carry on Soliders. I figure smth out.
[01:25] <lonewulf> s/I/I'll
[01:26] <[ByQ]Descent> I had a  lot of kind of strange problems (lags too - good srv), look at chown/chmod on .quakelive , try to run qlded in terminal under root and check
[01:27] <lonewulf> kk

[01:50] <Hajen_> Do i need to recompile it for x86 ?
[01:51] <Drayan> I think someone said it only worked with x64 but I don't really know
[01:51] <[ByQ]Descent> ... it's only for x64 as far as I know .. x86 in future .. maybe ..
[01:51] <Hajen_> have someone got it to work on x86 ?
[01:52] <Hajen_> I guess its all about the hook.
[01:52] * loveless has joined #qldedsrv
[01:52] <Hajen_> Have anyone tried to compile it ?
[01:53] <[ByQ]Descent> ..
[01:56] <syncore> it is only for x64, and you can talk to the guy who made it in #minqlbot
[01:56] <Hajen_> ok

[22:05] <[ByQ]Descent> :D
[22:11] <[ByQ]Descent> so only germans can fix problem with ql server? :D
[22:12] <[ByQ]Descent> sure that not  .. =)
[22:14] <DS4ever01> hahah xD no i dont think so... but its easy for me to explain in german than in english =D
[22:14] <DS4ever01> i need a sample script for freezetag instagib.. 
[22:15] <DS4ever01> and i cant find my server in the quake live serverlist/overview
[22:24] <[ByQ]Descent> try to connect it using /connect ip
[22:25] <[ByQ]Descent> check if it works ..

[23:37] <carmethene> holy shit, the proverek map
[23:37] <carmethene> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=560610357&searchtext=
[23:38] <carmethene> I've never seen this one before
[23:38] <McAfee> i guess the german figured it out, didnt even say thanks
[23:39] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[23:39] <McAfee> carmethene, it's nice to see original ideas in maps
[23:39] <McAfee> :P
[23:39] <carmethene> McAfee: my experience is that the community hates originality
[23:39] <carmethene> McAfee: have you seen that map?  the screenshot doesn't do it justice
[23:40] <carmethene> it's overkill and campgrounds stuck together
[23:40] <McAfee> i was being sarcastic
[23:40] <carmethene> given that those are basically the only two maps anyone ever callvotes
[23:40] <carmethene> I know you were
[23:40] <carmethene> I'm English, we invented sarcasm
[23:40] <carmethene> :P
[23:40] <McAfee> you need to mix campgrounds and bloodrun = epic
[23:40] <carmethene> interesting idea
[23:41] <sponge-> i had converted/mirrored bloodrun for ctf, it was a surprisingly good map
[23:41] <[ByQ]Descent> btw, is mappack with maps (ex:intelbloodrun) used anywhere?  is any problems with .pk3 downloadin and joinin servers?
[23:41] <carmethene> where did you put the mirror?
[23:41] <McAfee> sponge- weren't you off xD
[23:41] <McAfee> until monday :P
[23:41] <sponge-> no im in the office today im off tomorrow
[23:42] <carmethene> [ByQ]Descent: what do you mean?  bloodrunblue (the intel one) works fine
[23:42] <sponge-> carmethene: uh in that ya/pg room i think, the window where the quad spawns in ffa
[23:42] <carmethene> sponge-: gotcha
[23:42] <carmethene> that makes sense
[23:42] <[ByQ]Descent> ok , thnx :D
[23:43] <McAfee> i haven't seen the space variant of campgrounds in a while, is it still there?
[23:43] <carmethene> [ByQ]Descent: have to get the extra map pack from the workshop, not sure I understood your question
[23:43] <sponge-> its in the holiday pack
[23:43] <carmethene> McAfee: yes
[23:43] <carmethene> oh holiday pack? my bad
[23:43] <[ByQ]Descent> I know, saw the comments with problems, decided to wait until everything went ok .. 
[23:43] <carmethene> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539421606
[23:44] <carmethene> oh I get it
[23:44] <sponge-> https://www.dropbox.com/s/bgwc7eyu121hv36/ztnctf.bsp found it
[23:44] <carmethene> spacecamp is in the holiday pack
[23:44] <carmethene> derp
[23:44] <carmethene> [ByQ]Descent: oh, so there are definitely issues
[23:44] <carmethene> a number of people couldn't join the server (unpure pk3 kick) with those blue maps
[23:45] <carmethene> they all fixed it by nuking their quake install and downloading clean from Steam
[23:45] <[ByQ]Descent> thats it .. so thats why I'm asking ..
[23:45] <sponge-> thats fixed, people had the bloodrunintel.pk3 and zz_qcon_ads.pk3 in their dir
[23:45] <carmethene> sponge-: ah great
[23:45] <[ByQ]Descent> ok
[23:45] <carmethene> there's no way for me to add that ztn map without it being on the workshop right?
[23:46] <carmethene> unless I go non-pure
[23:46] <sponge-> its not really complete/suitable for play
[23:46] <carmethene> oh
[23:46] <sponge-> but you can +set sv_pure 0 and then dump it in your basepath baseq3 to load it up and try it
[23:46] <carmethene> ta
[23:48] <McAfee> in this day and age, can't a game be payed for and still have ads? or that's a no-no ?
[23:49] <sponge-> there aren't really any games that do in-game ads anymore
[23:50] * lonewulf has joined #qldedsrv
[23:50] * vtchill has joined #qldedsrv
[23:51] <McAfee> is the windows dedicated (using a shortcut) a definite failure, or it can run for a few weeks without crashing?
[23:51] <sponge-> but yea workshop wise, i'm not surprised, but still disappointed that it's just been q3 re-uploads all the way pretty much
[23:54] <McAfee> i'd expect most of the custom maps ever on a regular rotation to be ported at some point
[23:55] <McAfee> From a custom content point of view, is there anything quake3 can still do, that quake live would not be able to do? (eg: mods/scripts)
[23:55] * Danmer has quit IRC (Signed off)
[23:57] <[ByQ]Descent> maybe its more about q3 times, not mods/maps: in the early 200x were a lot internet clubs/cafes (in eastern europe for sure) to play q2/q3, clans, clanwars, a lot of local tourneys and etc.. 
[23:58] <McAfee> i mean from the point of view, of replacing what's left of the quake3 community, and not hear excuses
[23:58] <McAfee> it would be more people playing quakelive
[23:58] <McAfee> if everything was eventually ported
[23:59] <[ByQ]Descent> no local communities ... internet games - kind of depressive thing ..
[23:59] <sponge-> ql can't do mods but otherwise should be the same
[23:59] * PerpetualWar is now known as PerpetualWa_off
[23:59] <McAfee> i used to go a lot of lan parties, broadband made them obsolete
Session Time: Thu Nov 26 00:00:00 2015
[00:00] <sponge-> more people are not going to play ql if all the content from q3 was there since there's not really anyone playing q3 in any significant numbers either
[00:00] <McAfee> to go to*
[00:01] <McAfee> but still, is there anything that quake3 can do, that ql can't do?
[00:01] <McAfee> gibs xD
[00:02] <[ByQ]Descent> everything can be made by custom factory (balance)
[00:03] <McAfee> and as far as mods go?
[00:03] <carmethene> 13:00      sponge-@ : ql can't do mods but otherwise should be the same
[00:03] <[ByQ]Descent> t4 @ q3: 100 starting health, rail damage 100, +10 frags .. :D
[00:03] <carmethene> that said, minqlx is getting powerful enough now to be a mod platform
[00:06] <[ByQ]Descent> minqlx have problems with pointing itself, because the way "LD_PRELOAD" looks "not good" in case of "Steam" and "Id Software" licences ...
[00:07] <Drayan> what?
[00:07] <[ByQ]Descent> for sure, ql-managers had to have done kind of api to make such things "legal" ..
[00:08] <[ByQ]Descent> :D
[00:26] <sponge-> nope we didnt do crap for minqlx
[00:32] * trapgod has joined #qldedsrv
[00:40] <rzeka> Guys, what are sv_antic*Threshold for?
[00:40] <[ByQ]Descent> I mean that minqlx has to be ALREADY kind of osp for q3.. problem only with absence ql-c-api that brakes development of minqlx and ql ..
[00:46] <[ByQ]Descent> and another problem is servers monetization (not only ql), donation NOT-SOLUTION-FOR-SURE, my opinion is following: steam-top-managers have to be kicked right now.
[00:51] * g0rilla has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:52] <McAfee> i didnt understand that last sentence
[00:53] <[ByQ]Descent> :D sure you did ..
[00:54] <[ByQ]Descent> servers owners by default have part of subscriptions money ...
[00:55] <McAfee> server owners as in the people who own the farms and rent them, or as in the admin that is renting a server and managing it?
[01:00] <[ByQ]Descent> as people who making servers, which are part of business with money flows ..
[01:12] <carmethene> I have a problem...
[01:12] <carmethene> ra3map19 got updated like an hour ago
[01:12] <carmethene> someone called it
[01:12] <carmethene> so now anyone who connects, can't connect
[01:13] <carmethene> since steam is giving them a different version of the map to the server
[01:13] <carmethene> is there anything I can do about this situation?

[01:13] <[ByQ]Descent> [23:45] <sponge-> thats fixed, people had the bloodrunintel.pk3 and zz_qcon_ads.pk3 in their dir
[01:13] <[ByQ]Descent> [23:45] <carmethene> sponge-: ah great
[01:13] <[ByQ]Descent> [23:45] <[ByQ]Descent> ok
[01:13] <carmethene> I mean, I know I can delete the workshop maps and restart, but I have no way of knowing WHEN that is necessary and it's a lot to redownload
[01:13] <carmethene> just restarting the server doesn't seem to make it redownload the offending map either
[01:15] <[ByQ]Descent> ..thats why I do not use custom maps until this get resolved ..
[01:15] <McAfee> have a launch script that check for update, relaunch server once a week regardless
[01:16] <carmethene> I've written a script that kills my supervisor processes, deletes the maps, starts a single server, downloads them, kills that server and restarts supervisord
[01:16] <carmethene> so it's easy to sort, other than the time it takes
[01:16] <carmethene> it's just the complete lack of control over when it's necessary that's causing me issues
[01:16] <carmethene> like, he changed a map at lunchtime today, so what can I do?
[01:16] <McAfee> must the server be actually killed?
[01:16] <McAfee> cant a map change do the trick?
[01:16] <sponge-> you need to restart the server to check for workshop updates
[01:16] <carmethene> what sponge said
[01:16] <[ByQ]Descent> maybe it is on the client side?
[01:16] * b1ngo is now known as b1ngo|offline
[01:17] <carmethene> sponge-: restarting the server doesn't seem to actually download updates
[01:18] <carmethene> just confirmed it, killed the server, restarted, still on old version of the workshop map
[01:18] <carmethene> so, I guess I could nuke the workshop folder and start a different server process on some hidden port to repopulate the cache without killing the original server
[01:18] <carmethene> that's hacky and error prone though
[01:19] <McAfee> and then compare the files and restart the servers if not identical
[01:19] <McAfee> tedious
[01:20] <McAfee> i havent played with workshop stuff, at all
