[18:46] <mattiZed> guys, can you please give an overview who is logging?
[18:46] <mattiZed> inl, rulex and predathor?
[18:52] <rulex> correct
[18:53] <rulex> probably not the same servers but
[18:53] <rulex> though*
[18:53] <rulex> :)
[18:59] <mattiZed> kk
[18:59] <mattiZed> how is progress coming along? ::D
[19:01] <PerpetualWar_> slow :D
[19:01] <PerpetualWar_> thanks to PredatH0r's help I also set up stats collecting for my servers (mostly ca pickup)

[21:47] <rzeka> I log into sql database (data, match id and event type)
[21:47] <PredatH0r> idur: nice to meet motivated people :)
[21:47] <rzeka> basically I can reproduce json returned by ql :)

[13:45] <PredatH0r> new version of https://github.com/PredatH0r/XonStat/blob/master/feeder/feeder.node.js
[13:46] <PredatH0r> it will now reconnect to stats ZMQ when there is no activity for 15min (to solve the problem with QL just going silent)
[13:49] <PredatH0r> well, looks like i added a bug too :/
[13:52] <rulex> :)
[13:52] <PredatH0r> or to be more precise... i hit a bug in the zmq node module
[13:53] <PredatH0r> disconnect() and close() don't seem to free the socket resource. after a series or disconnect() + connect() i bang out with "too many open files"
[14:01] <PredatH0r> oh, interesting. disconnect needs an address as parameter
[14:02] <PredatH0r> looks like the whole zmq socket class allows connecting to multiple servers within a single instance
[14:07] <rulex> yea
[14:07] <rulex> same in python
[14:07] <PredatH0r> strange API. the password is set on the whole socket though, not per connection
[14:09] <PredatH0r> looks like passing the address to disconnect() solved my problem. close() alone didn't close the network connections
[14:12] <PredatH0r> good think i accidentally pasted my code with 1 min idle reconnect timeout. otherwise i would not have caught that problem in time :)
[14:12] <PredatH0r> good thing*

[17:49] <inl> Good afternoon! I've made a bunch of progress on the ql-stats-models for mongodb. I'm still writing unit test for a few game events, this helps me nail down the use-cases for the data model and also the API usage. 
[17:50] <inl> If life don't get in the way, I'll have something up on github during the weekend. It would be great if more people could help out with improving the data model and how we store information.
[17:51] <inl> My goal is to be able to provide an API/data storage solution that allows any server admin to opt-in and any user/developer to consume data from.
[17:53] <inl> And have the communite donate money to help pay for infrastructure costs.
[17:56] * idur has joined #stats.ql
[18:07] <PredatH0r> infrastructure cost? what kind of instrastructure are you planning to use?
[18:16] * PerpetualWa_afk is now known as PerpetualWar_
[18:30] <mattiZed> inl: much appreciated
[18:33] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[18:51] <rulex> right on
[18:58] <[ByQ]Descent> ..better to set up ql-currency-issue and forget about "US-Federal-Reserve-System", "Merkel" and others ... :D
[18:58] <PredatH0r> is any of the code checked in? ql-stats-engine and ql-server-monitor are 9 days old, ql-stats-api is removed
[18:59] <[ByQ]Descent> I'll try to set up it locally .. to test..
[19:06] <inl> mongodb/redis/nginx
[19:06] <inl> if i can find a suitable api proxy service that is affordable i'll skip nginx and cache through api proxy server
[19:06] <inl> node.js for api
[19:06] <inl> angular.js for webapp
[19:07] <inl> since things are changin quite a bit with the code-base i haven't released anything to the public.
[19:07] <rulex> i know dat feel
[19:07] <rulex> :)
[19:08] <inl> the api and data model will be release publicly but the layer which perform the actual persistance to redis and mongodb will be closed as that's my secret sauce
[19:08] <inl> but the ql-server-monitor and ql-stats-models will be available.
[19:09] <inl> so you will be able to set up your own server and stats tracking
[19:10] <PredatH0r> i had no idea this is going to be a closed source project
[19:10] <inl> everything is open source
[19:10] <inl> it's just a small portion that doesn't make sense to open source
[19:10] <inl> like HOW we do rank calculations and how we store stuff in redis
[19:11] <inl> that could be open sourced possibly, but for now i'd say it's better to let it be core developer thing
[19:11] <PredatH0r> if you keep some code to yourself, that also means you are the only developer who can even run this system
[19:12] <inl> No, that's not true.
[19:12] <inl> But the big point here is that why the fuck should we open source it
[19:12] <inl> that will fragment the whole thing
[19:12] <inl> what we need is money for infrastructure so we can host a platform for everyone
[19:13] <inl> what's key to getting QL to not DIE
[19:13] <inl> is an API that exposes ALL game data
[19:13] <inl> And allows developer for bots, balancing, etc to consume
[19:14] <inl> if i open source it all, then all of you will run in your own direction
[19:14] <inl> and we have 12 systems running and players suffer
[19:15] <PredatH0r> don't get me wrong. i'm not tryign to hold you back
[19:16] <inl> i will leave all core components open sourced, like the server monitor, the ql-stats-models (events to mongodb)
[19:16] <PredatH0r> atm i don't have the slightest insight of what's happening
[19:16] <inl> there is a layer inbetween there which is basically on game event, use this method in ql-stats-models to create/save/update player etc etc but there is also some stuff concearning redis lists and such
[19:17] <PredatH0r> so i don't even see a possibility to help you out with anything
[19:17] <inl> I'll happily fill you in, it's not that big of deal
[19:18] <inl> but now i need a dinner and glass of whine and wallow in the fact that finally it's weekend and i get to code all night with good conciense
[19:18] <PerpetualWar_> inl
[19:19] <PerpetualWar_> just one questiojn
[19:19] <PredatH0r> it's not really about me. if you do it all by yourself and release the final product when it's done, it might turn out that you're the only person able to maintain it
[19:19] <PerpetualWar_> I actually support PredatH0r in this
[19:19] <PerpetualWar_> having only one person maintain it
[19:19] <PerpetualWar_> is not good thing
[19:19] * rulex opens a beer
[19:19] <PredatH0r> ^ copy that
[19:19] <PerpetualWar_> but my question is this
[19:20] <PerpetualWar_> will we be able to take only certain stats
[19:20] <PerpetualWar_> (for example from ca pickup servers)
[19:20] <PerpetualWar_> and use only them for balancing if we wish so ?
[19:20] <PerpetualWar_> will the api provide that ability ?
[19:21] <PerpetualWar_> tbh I hoped for some project that will provide engine for ppl to set up on their servers
[19:22] <PerpetualWar_> and collect and balance using their servers only if they wished so
[19:22] <rulex> i believe it will if i understood correctly my previous talk with inl
[19:22] <PerpetualWar_> ok rulex thats good then
[19:23] <rulex> but it will probably take some time
[19:23] <rulex> i guess overall duel elo is prio 1
[19:23] <rulex> :)
[19:23] <PerpetualWar_> elo is already working ?
[19:23] <PerpetualWar_> right ?
[19:25] <rulex> think so
[19:25] <inl> overall main objective is getting servers and data into a system in a maintainable way so it can be exposed
[19:25] <inl> stats and ranks are separated
[19:25] <inl> logically
[19:26] <PerpetualWar_> any roadmap for the project ?
[19:31] <PredatH0r> PerpetualWar_: i uploaded a new feeder.node.js today. it will now reconnect automatically when a server is silent for 15min
[19:31] <inl> 1. set the data model
[19:31] <PerpetualWar_> oh cool PredatH0r
[19:31] <PerpetualWar_> link ?
[19:31] <inl> 2. integrate the data model with the ql-server-manager
[19:31] <rulex> <@PredatH0r> new version of https://github.com/PredatH0r/XonStat/blob/master/feeder/feeder.node.js
[19:32] <PredatH0r> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PredatH0r/XonStat/master/feeder/feeder.node.js
[19:32] <inl> 3. implement redis persistance of in-memory stuff
[19:32] <inl> 4. build api
[19:32] <inl> 5. implement team ranking algorithms
[19:32] <inl> 6. build web app
[19:33] * inl has left #stats.ql
[19:33] <rulex> 7. /part
[19:33] <PerpetualWar_> hm ?

[19:34] <PerpetualWar_> :)
[19:34] <rulex> :D
[19:34] <PerpetualWar_> we were like , huh? :D
[19:35] <rulex> he's done with our shit already
[19:36] <[ByQ]Descent> ..looks like new "Joint-Stock-Company" meeting ..
[19:36] <rulex> joint meeting, very interresting
[19:37] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[19:38] <PredatH0r> i'll be honest. i kind of miss the planning phase in this project
[19:38] <rulex> less planning, more doing
[19:39] <[ByQ]Descent> rulex - new "Executive Director" .. 
[19:39] <PredatH0r> a recipe to failure
[19:40] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[19:41] <rulex> B)
[20:11] * mattiZed has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[21:00] <inl> anyways, i'll be publishing the ql-stats-models within the next few days, i think it would be great to have some feedback on it.
[21:01] <inl> in short it's just mongoose schemas based on the t-sql schemas i've seen posted in here, plus some mongodb sugar/nosql benefits for the win and a bunch of unit test (where i use the game stats events JSON payloads as fixtures)
[21:02] <inl> tl;dr, ql event json to mongodb documents.
[22:09] <[ByQ]Descent> =)

[02:04] <carmethene> what is the current status btw?
[02:04] <carmethene> oh yes, my server is feeding into it
[02:05] <carmethene> I'm at #3 on active servers
[02:05] <carmethene> speaking of which
[02:05] <carmethene> PredatH0r: can I add my duel server too?
[02:05] <tjone270_> Ah :). rulex/PredatH0r/inl would be able to tell you more about how far the project's going.

[02:08] <carmethene> carmethene.com:27962
[02:09] <carmethene> 27960 is CA which you already have
[02:09] <carmethene> 61 is Instabounce should you want that
[02:09] <carmethene> they all share the same pass for stats
[02:09] <carmethene> wow, I could have said all that in way fewer lines
[02:09] <PredatH0r> done
[02:09] <carmethene> thank you :)
[02:13] * lonewulf has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:24] <sno> PredatH0r: any requirements for getting servers added to stats gathering on qlstats?
[02:25] <PredatH0r> atm none
[02:25] <sno> so doesn't matter if normal qlds or with minqlx etc?
[02:26] <PredatH0r> atm not, but there might be something later when real data collection / filtering starts
[02:27] <PredatH0r> right now it's all a mess in the database
[02:27] <sno> ok, mind adding the omega public ctf servers? we have one in nl and one in de
[02:27] <PredatH0r> sure. i need ip, port, pass (if any)
[02:29] <sno> pm'd, ta
[02:32] <sno> how are stats stored against player names, steamids or nicks?
[02:32] <PredatH0r> steam-ids
[02:32] <sno> cool
[02:33] <sno> how are stats gathered for ctf games?
[02:35] <sno> i mean is there a team game formula or something
[02:49] <PredatH0r> tbh, i have no idea. i use the xonstats code from xonotic. it's probably score based
[03:01] <sno> ah right

[03:49] <garz> hi
[03:56] <[ByQ]Descent> hi
[04:11] * vks has joined #stats.ql
[04:11] <garz> i can program and i have a vision for what i would like to do for ql, if i find the time
[04:11] <garz> what is the status with your vision?
[04:12] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[04:12] <[ByQ]Descent> what the problem just to do it?
[04:15] <garz> none
[04:17] <garz> the title of this channel says, its about people collaborating
[04:17] <garz> maybe i can be a part
[04:18] <garz> is there anything that is collaboratively done?
[04:18] <pex> it's 5 different projects all using 5 different technologies, not really worth the effort imo
[04:21] <garz> why not?
[04:25] <[ByQ]Descent> mm...every project developed by  author   ...
[04:26] <garz> ?
[04:26] <garz> so there are 5 different people doing something like qlranks
[04:27] <garz> everybody competing with each other
[04:39] <[ByQ]Descent> everything is in alpha status right now as far as I know .. 
[04:39] <garz> what else do you know :D
[04:39] <garz> just tell me everything =)

[20:09] <PredatH0r> welcome!
[20:09] <melba> )
[20:10] <melba> have you looked into trueskill or no time/
[20:10] <PredatH0r> no. trueskill is patented and licenses are exclusively given out to XBox games
[20:10] <melba> because i want to run a simulation against some match stats, see how's the rating inflation
[20:11] <melba> pretty sure you can use it in nonprofit stuff
[20:11] <melba> at least others are
[20:12] <PredatH0r> i can send you my match data collection if you like. but it's all unfiltered
[20:12] <melba> sure np
[20:12] <PredatH0r> or you can set up your own stats grabber for your servers
[20:17] <melba> i was going the road of trying to grab stats from pub servers, but if you already have some, even better
[20:21] <PredatH0r> http://beham.biz/2015-11.zip
[20:22] <[ByQ]Descent> ..got it
[20:23] <PredatH0r> some day we should have a discussion in here to figure out the criteria for matches that are included in the ranking/elo calculations
[20:24] <melba> cool, thanks. i'll report if i come up with some useful result 
[20:24] <melba> at least to contribute to the tribal knowledge if nothing else )

[22:59] <melba> PredatH0r, is it possible people are playing on many accounts or stealing each other's nicks? )
[22:59] <melba> have you noticed anything like that
[22:59] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[23:00] <PredatH0r> anyone can have any nick
[23:00] <PredatH0r> i just played vs. a polish sya_
[23:01] <[ByQ]Descent> yesterday  ffa server joined putin and played wavs: putins talks, USSR hymn and etc .. :D
[23:01] <PredatH0r> yea, he does it all the time. also the screaming monkeys
[23:02] <[ByQ]Descent> ..
[23:02] <melba> nice
[23:05] <melba> http://pastebin.com/SbbFMLZb
[23:05] <melba> scroll down
[23:05] <melba> at bottom in fact ;d
[23:10] <melba> forgot to remove instagib
[23:12] <[ByQ]Descent> and..
[23:12] <melba> http://pastebin.com/uVM5699E
[23:13] <melba> without insta
[23:13] <PredatH0r> you should do that by steam-id, not by nickname
[23:14] <PredatH0r> i appear multiple times with different color codes
[23:15] <melba> it is by steamid
[23:15] <PredatH0r> i just noticed. i see 2 different steam IDs for my nick
[23:15] <melba> yes
[23:15] <melba> that's why my initial question
[23:15] <PredatH0r> and neigher one is ranked as good as it should be :)
[23:18] <PredatH0r> actually, neither one of these 2 IDs is mine
[23:21] <[ByQ]Descent> :D
[23:25] <PredatH0r> they belong to "istwo" and "BlinD". according to the steam profile, they never used my nick
[23:25] <PredatH0r> oooooooh, i guess i know
[23:25] <PredatH0r> melba: listen up!
[23:25] <melba> i fixed that
[23:25] <PredatH0r> in the earlier files, i did not filter out the WARMUP stuff
[23:26] <PredatH0r> also, by speccing someone, they BECOME that player, including the steamid
[23:26] <[ByQ]Descent> >:-[         ]

[23:37] <PredatH0r> wtf. i found my steam id in your data. nickname "ArseMaster"
[23:37] <melba> i fixed that already
[23:37] <melba> )
[23:38] <PredatH0r>  :)
[23:38] <PredatH0r> ok. so no fundamental data problem?
[23:46] <melba> http://pastebin.com/Ff3a2r4R
[23:46] <melba> looks better
[23:46] <melba> hopefully ur id is correct )
[23:48] <melba> data should be fine
[23:49] <PredatH0r> looks a lot better
[23:57] <melba> the code http://pastebin.com/xLFN77PC

[00:09] <PredatH0r> i trying to find any reliable source about the trueskill license model. but there is none
[00:10] <PredatH0r> the guy who wrote the python implementation mentioned that it's free for non-commercial, but i can't find any confirmation for that
[00:10] <melba> yeah it's a gray area
[00:11] <melba> don't use it if you are worried
[00:12] <melba> but i'm not happy with elo for the team modes, so i had to do this
[00:15] <PredatH0r> did you take a look at the xonstat/qlstats rating code?
[00:15] <melba> yeah it uses sqlalchemy
[00:15] <melba> and i always think twice before learning yet another orm
[00:15] <melba> )
[00:16] <melba> it's gonna be a mess to change it
[00:16] <PredatH0r> efforts are underway to completely replace qlstats
[00:17] <PredatH0r> with something javascript / angularjs / nodejs /reactjs / mongoose / mogodb / redis / .... based
[00:17] <melba> yeah i'm not touching that
[00:17] <melba> )
[00:17] <melba> i just told them to use trueskill a few times
[00:17] <melba> but i doubt they will
[00:22] <PredatH0r> i'd prefer if rating numbers were transparent. they should only be used for matchmaking/shuffling
[00:23] <PredatH0r> ocd makes people do weired things
[00:23] <melba>  yeah was just talking to stitch about it
[00:24] <melba>  someone for lolca should make a minqlx shuffle plugin, i guess they are suffering the most
[00:25] <PredatH0r> right. i talked to mino yesterday
[00:25] <PredatH0r> i added an API URL to expose the rating values from qlstats.net for the time being
[00:25] <PredatH0r> it's using the same input/output as qlranks did, so it should be straight forward to implement
[00:26] <PredatH0r> i even ported my /elo userscript, but i won't make it public
[00:26] <melba> )
[00:27] <PredatH0r> the source code acutally is. but i won't bundle it with extraql
[00:49] <melba> PLAY_TIME i assume is since connected to server
[00:49] <melba> not since game started
[00:53] * melba_ has joined #stats.ql
[00:53] <melba_> final attempt http://pastebin.com/U0FupCDR
[00:53] <melba_> works well imo
[00:55] * melba has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[00:56] <PredatH0r> there is indeed something fishy with playtime
[00:56] <PredatH0r> i've seen players with 20h playtime out of a 10min match
[00:58] * idur has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
[00:59] <PredatH0r> i like the final version. i'm in the top 40 :)
[00:59] <melba_> no point punishing quits in ffa
[00:59] <melba_> which changes the rating's meaning from how likely you are to win the game itself to how likely are you to score more than others
[01:00] <PredatH0r> what do you mean? are you now extrapolating score/kill/death from playtime to matchtime?
[01:01] <melba_> i was thinking about it, because trueskill supports it, but don't think we have that data
[01:01] <PredatH0r> are you aggregating playtime/score if a player appears multiple times in a game (e.g. switching to spec and back)
[01:01] <melba_> server reports the total 
[01:02] <melba_> at least it used to
[01:02] <PredatH0r> cool
[01:02] <melba_> i doubt they changed it
[01:03] <PredatH0r> time for some bg ffa

[02:10] <inl> splurgh, data schemas coming along nicely. I'm managed to have a sort of optimized way of storing data up until match_report data event. (player_connect, player_disconnect, player_stats). Once i've completed the unit tests for match_report event I'd say the core db model/ persistance should be in place, i'll be publishing the repo once the last bit is in place and all unit tests pass.
