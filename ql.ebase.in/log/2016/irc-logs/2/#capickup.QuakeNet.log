[22:13] <fx> working
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> so locking is without pikup type
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> global

[22:14] <fx> PerpetualWar: maybe splitting lock by gametypes was in some 'next' branch
[22:14] <fx> dont remember
[22:14] <fx> but now it looks like only a global lock
[22:14] <PerpetualWar> ok
[22:15] <PerpetualWar> is theer !ban ?
[22:15] <fx> PerpetualWar: https://github.com/vityafx/jaibo/tree/master/ext/games/pickupbot/src/main/java/games/pickupbot/commands/messagelisteners
[22:15] <PerpetualWar> or not ?
[22:15] <fx> all commands by message are there
[22:15] <fx> sec gonna check for ban )
[22:15] <PerpetualWar> I can ban with Q no prob
[22:15] <PerpetualWar> just wanna know if its there
[22:15] <fx> i dont remember
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> ok dont bother with that
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> listen
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> one more thing I dont understand
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> someone do !iam
[22:16] <PerpetualWar> it supposedly makes profile in db
[22:16] <fx> it may crash some time, I dont remember the origin of this problem. You should know that. Contact me if it happens
[22:16] <fx> yesa
[22:16] <fx> it does
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> ok then I try to do !get_profile for that person
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> and it says no profile is there
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> only when I !set_profile
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> I can get_profile
[22:17] <fx> it is not working as simple as that
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> I cannot get_profile when only !iam
[22:17] <PerpetualWar> ye maybe Im missing something
[22:17] <fx> it was very hard for me the time I was developing the bot
[22:17] <fx> to get people irc assoc
[22:18] <fx> so it should be explicitly given to the command
[22:18] <fx> no the nick
[22:18] <fx> like
[22:18] <fx> !get_profile vitya@users.quakenet.org
[22:18] <fx> or something
[22:18] <fx> try
[22:18] <fx> I( doint remember
[22:18] <fx> :)
[22:18] <PerpetualWar> !get_profile vitya@users.quakenet.org
[22:18] <PerpetualWar> hm no
[22:18] <fx> no, use my irc info
[22:18] <fx> man
[22:18] <fx> use /whois
[22:19] <fx> on me
[22:19] <fx> and get by host
[22:19] <PerpetualWar> !get_profile ~vitya@vitya.users.quakenet.org
[22:19] <PerpetualWar> oh right
[22:19] <PerpetualWar> working like that
[22:19] <fx> working?
[22:19] <fx> and what does it say?
[22:19] <PerpetualWar> 20:19 from CAPickupBot - Host=[~vitya@vitya.users.quakenet.org] is bound to game profile=[FX]
[22:19] <fx> okay
[22:19] <fx> you may also change bindings
[22:19] <fx> but only admins can do that
[22:19] <fx> not player
[22:19] <fx> if a player has already a bind - it cant change it
[22:20] <fx> he will need to ask an admin
[22:20] <PerpetualWar> ye I saw that
[22:20] <PerpetualWar> I do that with !change_profile
[22:20] <PerpetualWar> correct ?
[22:20] <fx> yes, just looks at the source of the command handlers
[22:20] <fx> there is english
[22:20] <fx> you may read
[22:20] <fx> L)
[22:20] <PerpetualWar> ok
[22:21] <PerpetualWar> can bot take commands from some other channke |
[22:21] <PerpetualWar> ?
[22:21] <PerpetualWar> channel* ?
[22:22] <fx> as far as I remember it may sit on any number of channels you want
[22:22] <fx> and accept commands
[22:22] <fx> but it shares same instance between all the channels
[22:22] <fx> just like one bot taking many inputs
[22:23] <PerpetualWar> ok thats what Im asking
[22:23] <fx> I dont remember, try
[22:23] <PerpetualWar> so only thing is it my crash ?
[22:23] <fx> give me the log file
[22:23] <PerpetualWar> happens often ?
[22:23] <fx> no
[22:23] <fx> it depends well
[22:23] <fx> dont know
[22:23] <fx> used it like 4 months ago
[22:23] <fx> it was quite stable that time
[22:23] <PerpetualWar> what bot is used on qlpickup.ru ?
[22:24] <fx> dont know
[22:24] <fx> but not jaibo
[22:24] <PerpetualWar> whos bot admin there?
[22:24] <fx> h8m3
[22:24] <PerpetualWar> ok

[02:03] <PerpetualWar> whats best mask
[02:03] <PerpetualWar> for webchat ?
[02:03] <ulrich> *!*@....
[02:03] <ulrich> leave the webchat part
[02:03] <ulrich> they can just change to mirc/any irc client and set identd
[02:03] <PerpetualWar> *!*webchat@*.partofhost
[02:04] <PerpetualWar> this is annas
[02:04] <ulrich> yea
[02:04] <ulrich> which is really bad
[02:04] <PerpetualWar> you suggest
[02:04] <PerpetualWar> *!*@fulhost
[02:04] <PerpetualWar> ?
[02:04] <ulrich> yes
[02:04] <PerpetualWar> but if dynamic ip
[02:04] <PerpetualWar> they just get back in
[02:04] <ulrich> some times you ban *!webchat@123.13.13.*
[02:04] <ulrich> then you ban all users on that subnet
[02:04] <PerpetualWar> thats also annas
[02:04] <ulrich> yea i know

[02:05] <PerpetualWar> anyone else can add ?
[02:05] <PerpetualWar> need 4 more
[02:06] <ulrich> well
[02:06] <ulrich> either you ban *!*@fullhost or *!identd@fullhost
[02:06] <ulrich> identd being webchat or whatever they have
[02:06] <PerpetualWar> ye but
[02:07] <PerpetualWar> if dynamic ip ?
[02:07] <PerpetualWar> it will change next login ?
[02:07] <PerpetualWar> fullhost I mean
[02:08] <PerpetualWar> I guess wont happen tonight
[02:08] <ulrich> look at this example:
[02:08] <ulrich> [18:33:30] <ulrich> [17:10:44] <@Stormaren> !ban smofo 365d byebye
[02:08] <ulrich> [18:33:30] <ulrich> [17:10:45] * anna^ sets mode: +b *!webchat@*.adsl.xs4all.nl
[02:08] <ulrich> [18:33:30] <ulrich> [17:10:46] * smofo was kicked by anna^ ([52weeks 1day] byebye)
[02:08] <ulrich> [18:33:43] <ulrich> so you just banned all xs4all users using webchat for a year
[02:08] <PerpetualWar> ye i know
[02:08] <GoBo> =P
[02:08] <PerpetualWar> what Im saying
[02:08] <PerpetualWar> for webchat its not good
[02:08] <PerpetualWar> but for quakenet ident
[02:08] <PerpetualWar> its good
[02:09] <PerpetualWar> all depends
[02:09] <PerpetualWar> for webchat
[02:09] <ulrich> should just require ppl to be Q authed as well
[02:09] <ulrich> to add in here
[02:09] <PerpetualWar> maybe best *!*@fulhost
[02:09] <PerpetualWar> for webchat
[02:09] <ulrich> then you could just ban *!*@ulrich.users.quakenet.org 
[02:10] <ulrich> yea
[02:10] <GoBo> and later you can just not do +x come in again =)
[02:10] <ulrich> if you are Q authed it will know its you
[02:11] <PerpetualWar> I gtg sleep

[10:58] <PerpetualWar> no
[10:58] <wdx2> yes
[10:58] <Stormaren> maybe?
[10:58] <PerpetualWar> what yes ?
[10:58] <wdx2> :)
[10:58] <Stormaren> :D
[10:58] <PerpetualWar> you got something in the bag ?
[10:59] <wdx2> partial implimentation
[10:59] <PerpetualWar> how that works
[10:59] <wdx2> its logging if not 2 games
[10:59] <wdx2> :)
[10:59] <PerpetualWar> hm
[10:59] <wdx2> from when last game started
[10:59] <PerpetualWar> interesting
[10:59] <PerpetualWar> can we test that ?
[11:00] <wdx2> i've just to add that to the !add
[11:00] <wdx2> function
[11:00] <wdx2> however im still trying to work out fair way....
[11:00] <PerpetualWar> if thats possible wdx2
[11:00] <wdx2> via first quit or something
[11:00] <wdx2> yes its possible
[11:00] <PerpetualWar> that would solve us bunch of troubles
[11:01] <wdx2> just im half braindead at this time of morn
[11:01] <wdx2> :)
[11:01] <PerpetualWar> ok no rush
[11:01] <wdx2> the only part i have issue with is no sub is found to replace...
[11:01] <wdx2> if player only plays one game
[11:01] <wdx2> :)
[11:02] <wdx2> then it wouldnt let any of the other players at the moment add
[11:02] <wdx2> :D
[11:02] <wdx2> i dunoo if it will always be the first leaver or not ...
[11:02] <wdx2> to blame either
[11:02] <PerpetualWar> ye if leave after one map
[11:02] <PerpetualWar> we cannot influence that
[11:02] <PerpetualWar> and I dont think we need sub in that case
[11:03] <wdx2> if quit =  1
[11:03] <wdx2> :)
[11:03] <wdx2> can simply not allow add
[11:03] <PerpetualWar> for what time ?
[11:03] <wdx2> ANY TIME
[11:03] <wdx2> D:
[11:03] <PerpetualWar> hour ?
[11:03] <wdx2> whatever time period 
[11:03] <wdx2> you wish
[11:03] <PerpetualWar> hour
[11:04] <PerpetualWar> or
[11:04] <PerpetualWar> 2
[11:04] <wdx2> means even if someone quits with 10 seconds to go ...
[11:04] <PerpetualWar> no go with one
[11:04] <wdx2> thats a quit 
[11:04] <wdx2> :)
[11:04] <PerpetualWar> good
[11:04] <PerpetualWar> one hour cannot add
[11:04] <wdx2> you'd still be left with problem of soeone leaving after one map
[11:04] <PerpetualWar> they will be watchful more
[11:04] <wdx2> to sort that yourself
[11:04] <PerpetualWar> we will just ask manually for someone to sub
[11:05] <PerpetualWar> and that guy cannot add one hour
[11:05] <PerpetualWar> Im ok with that
[11:05] <PerpetualWar> thats very good wdx2 :D

[12:31] <wdx2> where game guid  = old ql gameguid
[12:31] <PerpetualWar> if yuo dont have those matchs in db ?
[12:31] <wdx2> if for instance qlranks
[12:31] <wdx2> u see gameguids
[12:32] <wdx2> you can import that data into db 
[12:32] <PerpetualWar> for example mu guid was: perpetual_war
[12:32] <PerpetualWar> so I do import that ?

[14:59] <wdx2> whats issue with rules and mappool being public? :)
[14:59] <trolles> thats fine
[14:59] <Linkyyy> not an issue, i think most of the messages should be public
[14:59] <Linkyyy> if you ask me
[14:59] <trolles> PerpetualWar why dont u put games to bo3 instead of only two matches?
[15:00] <trolles> sometimes u will have an "exciting" third map
[15:00] <PerpetualWar> cosnidering how ppl leave after first
[15:01] <trolles> first map?
[15:01] <PerpetualWar> ye
[15:01] <PerpetualWar> we might even put it to 1 :D
[15:01] <trolles> well, i have yet to see that
[15:01] <trolles> didnt happen to me
[15:01] <mu> who wants to bother with pickup for a 5 minute game?
[15:01] <trolles> if 1-1 i bet most of the time ppl will want a third
[15:02] <trolles> ye
[15:02] <Linkyyy> !w
[15:02] <[cabot]> Currently added: PerpetualWar, trolles, khorosayakisa, doz3r, Linkyyy, Stormaren
[15:03] <Stormaren> if the bot makes teams dir mu then 1map would be ok
[15:03] <Stormaren> imo
[15:03] <trolles> i disagree, if good teams are made, matchs will be closer, funnier to have some competition
[15:04] <Linkyyy> 1.wdx2
[15:04] <trolles> anyway, just my view
[15:04] <khorosayakisa> and if bad teams are made then two maps will suck )
[15:05] <wdx2> better why not let players decide :P 
[15:05] <wdx2> 1 map if wish more so be it 
[15:05] <wdx2> :)
[15:05] <khorosayakisa> nothing stopping people from staying on the server with the same teams 
[15:05] <wdx2> but khorosayakisa sometimes one map one team can do different 
[15:05] <trolles> khorosayakisa: that would be difficult if it is not a rule
[15:05] <wdx2> than other 
[15:06] <wdx2> so eg 10-4 game can then be 2-10 game on an entirely different map
[15:06] <wdx2> ;)
[15:06] <khorosayakisa> trolles: then other people didnt want to play more with the same teams
[15:06] <mu> its a pickup server not a "stay if u have fun" server
[15:06] <trolles> khorosayakisa: no, ppl will rush to the irc for next game
[15:06] <PerpetualWar> you cannot stay on server unless you in next game
[15:07] <PerpetualWar> that goes without saying
[15:07] <mu> yeah
[15:07] <khorosayakisa> what does leaving the server have to do with rushing to irc? xD
[15:07] <trolles> everything, ppl will add and they wont be same teams
[15:07] <khorosayakisa> yes but you dont have to leave the server to add for the next
[15:08] <trolles> man, i dont think it is so difficult to understand lol
[15:08] <khorosayakisa> it is not so difficult to understand no
[15:08] <khorosayakisa> but there is no difference between you wanting a third because two first were good
[15:08] <khorosayakisa> and people not wanting a second because the first sucked
[15:09] <trolles> yes there is a difference, u go to pickups because there is more chance to happen the first than the second
[15:10] <khorosayakisa> personally I wouldnt mind since I find the turn around time to be annoying and high on pickups
[15:10] <khorosayakisa> with bots picking teams it will become lower though
[15:11] <khorosayakisa> or should be

[16:20] <khorosayakisa> the magners/fusion and stormaren/linkyyy are probably good matchups in a 4v4 scenario but I would change place on the other two pairs

[16:21] <khorosayakisa> or matching pickup style kinda?
[16:21] <wdx2> best rated worse rated 2nd best with 2nd worst  closest with average from the other 4 
[16:21] <wdx2> can try !teams 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

[16:22] <wdx2> same as that 
[16:22] <wdx2> to see potential teams
[16:22] <khorosayakisa> can you make them 1-1-1-1-2-1?
[16:22] <wdx2> red and blue are random
[16:22] <wdx2> can make them via whatever method 
[16:22] <wdx2> but above has shown good for other pickup channels best with worst 2nd best with 2nd worst then close as possible...
[16:23] <wdx2> such as rupickups and tdmpickups
[16:23] <khorosayakisa> yes it sounds good

[18:30] <khorosayakisa> I dont like the new rating and not because I am lowly rated
[18:30] <khorosayakisa> I just think it has an effect on the meta of the game that is not positive
[18:31] <PerpetualWar> what ya mean ?
[18:31] <cabelO> !w
[18:31] <[cabot]> Currently added: PerpetualWar, trolles, khorosayakisa, vrs, cabelO
[18:31] <khorosayakisa> theoretically speaking is it better to be the teamplayer or the ffa player?
[18:31] <PerpetualWar> when you say new rating you dont mean this chnage from yesterday ?>
[18:32] * math1as has joined #capickup
[18:32] * Prophy has joined #capickup
[18:32] <PerpetualWar> or you mean rating in general on this chan ?
[18:32] <khorosayakisa> the calculations that its based on
[18:32] <khorosayakisa> it does not really promote teamplay
[18:32] <PerpetualWar> games are close enough afaik
[18:32] <math1as> Does it necessarily have to khorosayakisa?
[18:32] <PerpetualWar> thats what balancing shoudl do
[18:33] <khorosayakisa> no it doesnt necessarily have to :)
[18:33] <PerpetualWar> not promote any specific kind of gameplay
[18:33] <math1as> I agree with PerpetualWar
[18:33] <khorosayakisa> but this promotes a certain kind
[18:33] <khorosayakisa> or rather changes the meta for it
[18:33] <PerpetualWar> no it doesnt
[18:33] <khorosayakisa> yes it does
[18:33] <math1as> It doesn't
[18:33] <PerpetualWar> sorry but it doesnt
[18:33] <khorosayakisa> lets say you have two players on one team
[18:33] <khorosayakisa> who care about rating
[18:33] <math1as> This rating means nothing, yet it is a rating. Therefor people do not play differently
[18:33] <khorosayakisa> what will they do?
[18:34] <khorosayakisa> people care about the rating
[18:34] <math1as> So you say people wants to be the most playing player?
[18:34] <khorosayakisa> no people like having a high rating :)=
[18:34] <PerpetualWar> they will try play better ?
[18:34] <math1as> I'm talking about this rating system ofcourse
[18:34] <khorosayakisa> but what is better perp?
[18:34] <PerpetualWar> everyone has his style
[18:34] <math1as> It wouldn't show on the rating PerpetualWar
[18:34] <math1as> Rating is only how many games played
[18:34] <PerpetualWar> I dont think rating will make you change you rstyle
[18:35] <PerpetualWar> or rather it shouyldnt
[18:35] <PerpetualWar> if it happen
[18:35] <khorosayakisa> no it shouldnt
[18:35] <khorosayakisa> but it will and has
[18:35] <khorosayakisa> imo
[18:35] <math1as> And this type of rating doesn't
[18:35] <PerpetualWar> we could deny showing rating
[18:35] <rawx> if you don't like it here, there is always public servers
[18:35] <math1as> Not this kind of rating khorosayakisa
[18:35] <rawx> :|
[18:35] <PerpetualWar> but we have yet to see
[18:35] <khorosayakisa> ok
[18:35] <math1as> rawx spitting the truth
[18:35] <PerpetualWar> its all so early khorosayakisa
[18:35] <khorosayakisa> I will not do feedback then
[18:35] <khorosayakisa> sorry
[18:35] <PerpetualWar> no we appreciate feedback
[18:35] <math1as> You don't give feedback
[18:35] <khorosayakisa> it doesnt seem like it now does it
[18:35] <PerpetualWar> but I think you are really early with real feedback
[18:35] <rawx> this chan is to have fun games with equal teams
[18:35] <PerpetualWar> this is all guessing at this point
[18:36] <khorosayakisa> if being told that you can go to public servers if youdont like it here
[18:36] <rawx> if people just understand that we won't have a problem
[18:36] <PerpetualWar> I mean balancing were in eefect one day
[18:36] <math1as> Are you saying, that this kind of rating system have affected the playstyle of the people playing here? khorosayakisa
[18:36] <khorosayakisa> rawx do you agree that people care about rating?
[18:36] <PerpetualWar> we need at least month
[18:36] <PerpetualWar> to draw conclusions
[18:36] <rawx> I don't know
[18:36] <khorosayakisa> I am saying it has and that it will if nothing else
[18:36] <rawx> some are more competitive than others, yes
[18:36] <rawx> and rating is just for this channel, not like public elo
[18:36] <rawx> if I'm correct
[18:36] <PerpetualWar> I know that you are worried it might go that way
[18:36] <math1as> Rating systems in general, yeah people care. This kind of rating system? In my wildest imagination i couldn't see why people would care.
[18:36] <PerpetualWar> but like I said if it becomes trend
[18:37] <PerpetualWar> we wil disable publicj showing of rating
[18:37] <PerpetualWar> it will be used only internally
[18:37] <PerpetualWar> for balancing purposes
[18:37] <rawx> that's good
[18:37] <PerpetualWar> so you wont be able to see you rrating at all
[18:37] <PerpetualWar> and just focus on playing
[18:37] <khorosayakisa> that is what you should do now already then until you have enough data :)
[18:37] <PerpetualWar> I know stats-whoring is possible problem
[18:37] <PerpetualWar> but still to early
[18:38] <khorosayakisa> it would be better to disable it now so people dont potentially play for the rating
[18:38] <PerpetualWar> we still focusing on maing better balance at this point
[18:38] <math1as> you can't take data from something public, if it isn't public :q
[18:38] <khorosayakisa> I meant disable showing it
[18:38] <khorosayakisa> then people would just play
[18:39] <Stormaren> its beta
[18:39] <PerpetualWar> ye we can disable !rating cvar
[18:39] <khorosayakisa> and then you would know if rating was "accurate" or not
[18:39] <math1as> And you think they doesn't khorosayakisa?
[18:39] <Stormaren> people needs to see
[18:39] <PerpetualWar> but I would say its all just worry at this point khorosayakisa
[18:39] <PerpetualWar> we are keeping an eye on it though

[18:41] <Todesknecht> !rating stormaren
[18:41] <Stormaren> how can u abuse the ratin? like rly
[18:41] <khorosayakisa> that is why imo it would be better to not let that factor be there
[18:41] <Stormaren> just cuz gohan_ and some others whined alriear today
[18:41] <khorosayakisa> you cant abuse the rating but you can play to improve your rathing
[18:41] <Stormaren> but they always back and camp
[18:41] <PerpetualWar> khorosayakisa I agree it was BIG problem with elo and qlranks
[18:41] <Stormaren> just play for fun
[18:41] <PerpetualWar> I was really agtainst it
[18:41] <Stormaren> yeeees
[18:42] <PerpetualWar> but here we will see
[18:42] <khorosayakisa> perp the diff with qlranks and elo was
[18:42] <khorosayakisa> that your rating was based on winning
[18:42] <PerpetualWar> no nneed to jump to conclusions
[18:42] <khorosayakisa> so no win no elo
[18:42] <PerpetualWar> and we are modifying formula still
[18:42] <khorosayakisa> but with this you can gain without winning :)
[18:42] <PerpetualWar> and thats the reason why I dont wanna share formula with pub
[18:42] <math1as> The only player i would accuse of whoring stats would be tihol, no offense to him.
[18:43] <khorosayakisa> how would you abuse qlranks really? by winning games?
[18:43] <Todesknecht> winning should be the only thing factored
[18:43] <Todesknecht> nothign else matters
[18:43] <khorosayakisa> todes <3
[18:43] <khorosayakisa> this

[02:24] <Stormaren> poll or not, people will whine :)
[02:25] <v1c`> OH NO this map is soo dark... its not my fucking noobish setting... i blame the map *cry cry*
[02:25] <v1c`> awesome these days
[02:25] <v1c`> but it made me laugh so much
[02:25] <v1c`> :D
[02:25] <wdx2> haha
[02:25] <wdx2> which map v1c`
[02:25] <Stormaren> ra3map15 and 20
[02:25] <v1c`> all those ra3 converted maps
[02:26] <v1c`> those newie whine about and im sure they prolly use vertex
[02:26] * Prophy has joined #capickup
[02:26] <ulrich> whats wrong with vertex
[02:26] <v1c`> disable it and all maps are looking fine and bright
[02:26] <Stormaren> r_mapoverbrightbits 3 and they shine bright and nice :)
[02:27] <v1c`> there was any update were they did change something
[02:27] <v1c`> about vertex i mean
[02:27] <Stormaren> y, thats looong ago
[02:27] <Stormaren> i think
[02:27] <v1c`> yea
[02:27] <v1c`> mb 1,5 years
[02:27] <v1c`> in past std value was vertex one
[02:28] <v1c`> after that update they changed std to 0 i guess, but i dunno exactly
[02:28] * Prophy has quit IRC (Signed off)
[02:29] <mem> V - E + F = 2
[02:29] <matte> when i remember corretly they changed that vertex 0 sets dynamiclight to 0 too
[02:29] <matte> so you can have vertex 0 and dynamic 1
[02:29] <v1c`> ye could be
[02:30] <v1c`> cannot remember well

[18:21] <[m44]poomeR> Jag vet dock inte om dem kan ställa ner det utan i så fall tar dem bort det helt. Skulle det funka för dig?
