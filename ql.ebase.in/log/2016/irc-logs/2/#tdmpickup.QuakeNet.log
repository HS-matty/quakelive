[05:58] <doz3r> help with?
[05:59] <huehuehuehue> quality feedback, left some details in the description
[05:59] <doz3r> its too dark
[06:00] <huehuehuehue> that might be intentional :D
[06:00] <doz3r> meh
[06:00] <doz3r> :P
[06:01] <huehuehuehue> but ye my screen gamma / contrast is fucked beyond help
[06:01] <huehuehuehue> i cannot for the life of me get it properly calibrated
[06:01] <huehuehuehue> so it might not be intentional also :p
[06:01] * deg has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[06:01] <huehuehuehue> i was more referring to picture quality
[06:02] <doz3r> buy an IPS monitor
[06:03] <huehuehuehue> i didn't intend to have a large budget for this fragmovie
[06:05] <doz3r> not only for the fragmovie was meant in general
[06:05] <doz3r> if your laptop is that crappy
[06:06] <huehuehuehue> i might invest in a proper pc if i return to the quakes
[06:07] <huehuehuehue> as i dont really play other games
[06:10] * crazyal has quit IRC (Signed off)
[06:15] <_ash> huehuehuehue yo
[06:15] <_ash> huehuehuehue when next movie?
[06:16] <huehuehuehue> perhaps a couple of weeks
[06:16] <huehuehuehue> scenes have been fully scouted
[06:16] <_ash> cool
[06:16] <huehuehuehue> the film crew have been dropped off at their locations tonight
[06:16] <_ash> cant wait to see it
[06:16] <huehuehuehue> so filming will start tomorrow
[06:17] <huehuehuehue> as long as no polar bears attack
[06:18] <huehuehuehue> MY BUDGET DOESNT INCLUDE POLAR BEAR ATTACKS
[06:19] <_ash> =\
[06:19] <_ash> also
[06:19] <_ash> i remember in King of fire
[06:19] <_ash> was a really weird fov
[06:19] <_ash> in the upcoming one its the same?
[06:21] <huehuehuehue> there is nothing really weird about 120 fov ash
[06:21] <huehuehuehue> 120 fov is as good as it gets
[06:21] <huehuehuehue> although i was messing around with vertical fov too
[06:21] * Fog_of_wAfh has left #tdmpickup
[06:21] <huehuehuehue> maybe that was an issue
[06:23] * cenix is now known as CENiX
[06:27] <_ash> i just think
[06:27] <_ash> game looks better with 90-105 fov
[06:27] <_ash> for movie
[06:28] <huehuehuehue> i think for rocket frags it looks a bit "clunky"
[06:28] <huehuehuehue> i prefer high fov for rocket frags so you can appreciate the angles involved in the shots
[06:28] <huehuehuehue> because i'd like people who never played quake to understand what's happening when watching it
[06:37] * sev1 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[06:37] <huehuehuehue> and this movie is gonna be all about the rockets

[18:42] <jim_henson> Un test debe cumplir dos requisitos b√°sicos. En primer lugar debe medir el rasgo que realmente pretende medir (es decir, ser v√°lido) y, en segundo lugar, las puntuaciones emp√≠ricas obtenidas al aplicar el test deben ser estables y precisas. La precisi√≥n hace referencia, como ya hemos apuntado anteriormente, a la necesidad de que, en la medida de los posible, las puntuaciones obtenidas 
[18:42] <jim_henson> est√©n libres de errores. La estabilidad se refiere a que cuando se eval√∫a un rasgo con el mismo test en distintas ocasiones y bajo condiciones lo m√°s parecidas posibles, siempre y cuando el rasgo estudiado no haya cambiado, se deber√°n obtener unos resultados similares. Este segundo requisito, referido a la reproductividad de unos resultados en condiciones similares, es lo que definimos 
[18:42] <jim_henson> como la fiabilidad del test, entendida como estabilidad de las medidas. En definitiva, lo que pretendemos es poder establecer el grado de acuerdo entre las puntuaciones obtenidas por los sujetos en distintas aplicaciones.
