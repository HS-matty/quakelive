[01:43] <[ByQ]Descent> have number of servers (ql.ebase.in)
[01:43] <[ByQ]Descent> and looks like x64(?) version eats a lot of memory
[01:44] <[ByQ]Descent> (even on empty and rebooted server)
[01:44] <[ByQ]Descent> debian 7(8) / x64
[01:45] <[ByQ]Descent> top shows a that all qlzeroded.x64 processed eat max 512 and all other just nothing, but 1gig (2gigs too) are full ...
[01:47] <[ByQ]Descent> atop shows a lot of dublicated proccees (qzeroded.x64) with the same names and explain memory problems ..
[01:49] <[ByQ]Descent> not atop - htop
