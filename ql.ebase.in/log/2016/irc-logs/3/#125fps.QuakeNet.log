[23:13] <funnyb> we just want christmas ham and presents
[23:14] <the_sonic> the lights are sweet as fuck

[23:14] <hauer> What happed to "at drikke julen ind"?
[23:14] <funnyb> dno

[23:18] <funnyb> in sweden
[23:18] <the_shpuld> you're probably right
[23:18] <the_sonic> perhaps this crit damage is only +25% when using vats spacebar TRIGGER
[23:18] <the_sonic> but that's cool
[23:18] <the_sonic> i'll take it
[23:18] <funnyb> that'd suck though sonic, vats is for ppl who cant aYM
[23:18] <the_shpuld> is there LG in fo4

[23:31] <the_sonic> they +back

[23:38] <funnyb> yes i would
[23:38] <funnyb> with a stick or two
[23:39] <the_sonic> funnyb the real reason why i never use power armour is 'cause it removes all carry point upgrades
[23:39] <the_sonic> even though you step into the fucking power armour wearing your own modified pocketed armour
[23:40] <xiphos> Who have experience with Avermedia capture cards? :)
[23:40] <the_sonic> i hav 385 inv
[23:40] <funnyb> im hoping to get better armors from brotherhood of steel, wont use this first scrappy edition
[23:40] <the_sonic> and i think 100 of that is my modified armour
[23:41] <funnyb> nice
[23:41] <the_sonic> so as soon as he gets in power armour he walks like he's shit himself
[23:41] <the_sonic> dunno if it's a bug or a "feature"
[23:41] <funnyb> do you have a ton of power cores?
[23:41] <funnyb> in case you'd like to use it
[23:41] <the_sonic> it's not like you take off current armour before getting into power armour
[23:41] <the_sonic> yeah
[23:41] <the_sonic> 30 or so
[23:41] <funnyb> nice
[23:42] <the_sonic> they're in every building almost
[23:42] <the_sonic> i'm carrying about 30 guns
[23:42] <the_sonic> that's the problem
[23:42] <the_sonic> but that's why i upgraded my god damn armour 
[23:42] <funnyb> yeah i'd like a big chest where i could store it all
[23:43] <the_sonic> no i mean, i want to
[23:43] <the_sonic> well perhaps 20 guns
[23:43] <funnyb> do you use 30 diff guns?
[23:43] <funnyb> :D
[23:43] <the_sonic> i use them all
[23:43] <the_sonic> like 4 main
[23:43] <the_sonic> but switch out a lot
[23:44] <the_sonic> oh.. i like this one
[23:44] <the_sonic> nononono this one now
[23:44] <the_sonic> but if you decide you don't like certain weapons mid quest
[23:44] <the_sonic> you can't fast travel back to base
[23:44] <the_sonic> that would suck

[00:02] <the_shpuld> can't eat uncooked grenades
[00:02] <the_sonic> lol
[00:02] <the_sonic> i'm being serious man
[00:03] <the_sonic> you can't fucking cook grenades
[00:03] <the_sonic> it's disgusting
[00:03] <the_shpuld> a few games let you cook grenades
[00:03] <the_shpuld> even hl2 required manual usage of gravity gun to cook them
[00:03] <the_sonic> i could 1shot kill like the enemies can if i could cook :s
[00:03] <the_shpuld> and hl1 grenades were just shit in the first place

[00:04] * the_sonic rages like super mutant
[00:06] <the_sonic> i don't really care that much at all
[00:07] <the_sonic> anything i say is over exaggerated to the point of gibberish 
[00:07] <the_sonic> would probably make the fights too easy 
[00:07] <the_shpuld> I liked in deus ex if you played on "realistic", you'd die to enemy headshots
[00:07] <the_sonic> main reason i throw grenades is i want to see the boom
[00:07] <the_shpuld> even with the weakest weapons
[00:08] <the_sonic> i don't like the sound of that :s
[00:08] <the_shpuld> in deus ex it worked
[00:08] <the_shpuld> because you could play it stealthy
[00:08] <the_shpuld> and it was fun playing it stealthy
[00:08] <the_sonic> as long as you could kill the enemy like that
[00:08] <the_shpuld> so if you got in a situation where a security bot fires a huge spread of lead at you, you should count yourself lucky to be alive
[00:09] <the_shpuld> and yes
[00:09] <the_sonic> oh, well that's cool then
[00:09] <the_shpuld> it affected enemies as well, your own damage was also boosted
[00:09] <the_sonic> dang
[00:09] <the_shpuld> it's the best way to play the game
[00:09] <the_shpuld> unless you're a newbie and don't know what to do
[00:09] <the_shpuld> but once you're familiar with the mechanics and all the toys
[00:09] <the_shpuld> then it's _fun_
[00:09] <the_sonic> you mean like when i played it whenever it was released :p
[00:10] <the_shpuld> or like when I played it for the first time
[00:10] <the_shpuld> and didn't think it was very good

[00:18] <the_shpuld> indeed
[00:19] <the_shpuld> when borderlands 1 was coming out
[00:19] <the_shpuld> me and 3 buddies preordered the 4pack
[00:19] <the_shpuld> to play the shit at launch in coop
[00:19] <the_sonic> and time counted even when it's in browser minimised is counted isn't it?
[00:19] <the_shpuld> 32 hours during the first weekend, it was released on friday
[00:19] <the_sonic> lul
[00:19] <the_sonic> 1337

[00:21] <the_sonic> i think that's a skill in itself

[01:03] <the_shpuld> do you keep track of people who unfollow you?
[01:03] <the_sonic> what is the point of unfollowing someone YOU followed in the first place
[01:03] <the_sonic> yup
[01:03] <the_shpuld> why
[01:03] <the_sonic> with the click of a button
[01:04] <the_sonic> why not
[01:04] <the_sonic> same as getting notification from a follower 
[01:05] <the_sonic> you've been followed by xxxxxxxxx
[01:05] <the_sonic> omg that guy is leeeeeeeeet
[01:06] <the_sonic> you've been followed by someone who followed you in the first place but unfollowed you because you tweeted about something they didn't like
[01:06] <the_sonic> omg that guy suuuuuuuucks
[01:07] <the_sonic> (joking)
[01:07] <the_sonic> it's like clicking on ammo in fallout 
[01:07] <the_sonic> although it's interesting thinking about how certain tweets cause people to instantly unfollow you
[01:10] <the_shpuld> there's some tweets that make me unfollow people
[01:10] <the_shpuld> especially if they're people I don't really know and thought looked interesting
[01:10] <the_shpuld> but then I realize they just post garbage
[01:10] <the_sonic> but that's what i mean
[01:10] <the_sonic> i post something relating the very fucking reason they followed me in the first place
[01:11] <the_sonic> and they delete me
[01:13] * xiphos has quit IRC (Signed off)
[01:14] <the_sonic> another reason is 'cause they think having less "following" than "followers" is leet

[01:20] <the_sonic> vats
[01:20] <the_sonic> kill them to salvage the nuke
[01:20] <the_sonic> or target the nuke for luls
[01:21] <the_sonic> you can kill them without vats
[01:21] <the_sonic> but i guess not at your level
[01:22] * dem0n has joined #125fps
[01:22] <the_sonic> they +forwarded faster than i could do damage at low level
[01:22] <the_sonic> <funnyb> i got no ammo for good guns
[01:22] <the_sonic> this has been my bane for the past week
[01:23] <the_sonic> even though i have scrounger perk
[01:23] <funnyb> yeah
[01:23] <the_sonic> the way it works must depend on what other stats and what order you added them
[01:23] <the_sonic> or something
[01:23] <funnyb> all im asking for is an unlimited supply of ammo for my lasergun, is that too much to ask for
[01:23] <the_sonic> 'cause some people find too much ammo :o
[01:23] <the_sonic> loooooooool
[01:23] <the_sonic> no
[01:24] <the_sonic> come on man
[01:24] <the_sonic> you ask me why i have 24 weapons
[01:27] <the_shpuld> you ask me why I have 3 balls
[01:27] <the_sonic> wtf
[01:28] <the_shpuld> then I say "I don't have 3 balls"
[01:29] <the_sonic> i love talking to people when i have a mohawk and a gas mask
[01:29] <the_sonic> it's just like real life
[01:29] <the_sonic> this is why i love f4
[01:29] <funnyb> ye the_sonic
[01:29] <funnyb> im starting to get the weapon situation
[01:29] <the_sonic> wat do you mean
[01:30] <the_sonic> need more than a couple
[01:30] <funnyb> having to carry around 20 guns yeah
[01:30] <the_sonic> so you don't run out of ammo?
[01:30] <the_sonic> :s
[01:30] <funnyb> but like
[01:30] <funnyb> every gun i have apart from the one brotherhood of steel gave me
[01:30] <funnyb> is total shit
[01:30] <funnyb> but my poon slayer
[01:30] <funnyb> is awesome
[01:30] <funnyb> i just never have ammo for it
[01:30] <the_sonic> well it just so happens my fave gun is my sg

[02:07] <the_sonic> i'm not talking to my gf
[02:08] <the_sonic> http://i.imgur.com/tspi1iC.jpg
[02:08] <the_sonic> i'm here
[02:09] <the_shpuld> me neither the_sonic 
[02:09] <the_shpuld> and I am having fun
[02:10] <the_sonic> i would expect nothing less
[02:10] <the_sonic> even when you're coding for uni exam thing
[02:11] <the_sonic> if the_shpuld told me he wasn't having fun this would be my reaction http://i.imgur.com/zC4lAQy.jpg
[02:11] <the_shpuld> instead of talking to gf, the_sonic talks to skullman on facebook
[02:12] <the_sonic> incredulous
[02:12] <the_sonic> loool
[02:12] <the_sonic> man
[02:12] <the_sonic> i've been talking to skullman since 1998
[02:13] <the_sonic> he is a legend

[02:16] <the_sonic> and he was skullman
[02:16] <the_shpuld> my best long time friends are from 2005 :V
[02:16] <the_sonic> that was pretty much all i needed to know
[02:16] <the_sonic> that's still bretty good going
[02:17] <the_shpuld> that's when I moved to another city
[02:17] <the_shpuld> and got good friends there

[02:22] <the_sonic> there's quite a few people i remember as online friends from as early as 2001
[02:23] <the_sonic> actual people you know in person
[02:23] <the_shpuld> right
[02:23] <the_shpuld> most people I like that are originally irl friends but these days mostly just talk/play online
[02:26] <the_sonic> suppose it's like regular friends

[02:27] <the_sonic> someone i knew irl who played quake all the time when we were in school
[02:27] <the_sonic> was super into gaming
[02:28] <the_sonic> he doesn't even having a pc or console anymore
[02:28] <the_sonic> fuck that shit
[02:29] <the_shpuld> rib
[02:29] <the_shpuld> it's a bit different when quake was the mainstream game back then
[02:29] <the_sonic> i suppose :/
[02:29] <the_shpuld> I also know plenty of people I used to game with less than 10 years ago
[02:29] <the_shpuld> that don't care about games at all now
[02:29] <the_shpuld> but yeah that's normal
[02:30] <the_sonic> sick fucks
[02:30] <the_sonic> same with every interest i suppose
[02:31] <the_sonic> i remember back in 2003 or something people leaving home to go squat in some flat with other bmxers
[02:31] <the_shpuld> got myself, got irc, what else do you need?
[02:31] <the_sonic> so that they could ride every day 
[02:32] <the_sonic> and now.. they couldn't pedal a bike if they wanted to.. and they don;t
[02:33] <the_sonic> i just don't understand how you can just drop something that was majorly important in your life
[02:33] <the_sonic> completely 
[02:33] <the_shpuld> yeah I dunno
[02:33] <the_shpuld> losing interest gradually until it's not important at all
[02:34] <the_sonic> i don't care what i do in life i know i'll be able to play some sort of computer game
[02:34] <the_sonic> suppose everyone is different :o

[02:42] <the_sonic> it was in the first "i'm pretty sure it's in this area" i checked
[02:42] <the_shpuld> "love" in quotation marks
[02:42] <the_sonic> just didn't look in the right place
[02:42] <the_sonic> spent 40mins looking everywhere else
[02:43] <the_shpuld> morrowind had no quest markers at all so all the info was given in descriptions
[02:43] <the_shpuld> that was cool
[02:43] <the_sonic> it's all good as long as you can maintain interest in the game 
[02:43] <the_shpuld> like, really fucking awesome
[02:43] <the_sonic> it also had more than one sentence dialogue options iirc :o
[02:44] <the_shpuld> its dialogue system was a fucking wiki
[02:44] <the_shpuld> but it worked
[02:44] <the_sonic> that's that shit i like
[02:44] <the_shpuld> and it allowed them to really focus on a lot of writing
[02:44] <the_sonic> i want to read
[02:44] <the_shpuld> because no voice acting
[02:44] <the_sonic> i love reading 
[02:44] <the_shpuld> and you can read at your own pace
[02:44] <the_shpuld> oblivion showed so little subtitles at any time it was annoying
[02:45] <the_sonic> :/
[02:46] <the_shpuld> morrowind let you do everything at your own pace, which was cool
[02:46] <the_shpuld> and if your speed+athletics+acrobatics were really high, that pace was super fast
[02:46] <the_shpuld> realistic? fuck no
[02:46] <the_shpuld> fun? yes
[02:47] <the_shpuld> and still kept me interested in the game world and events
[02:48] <the_sonic> the rpg style was leet as fuck
[02:48] <the_sonic> only problem was no guns
[02:48] <the_sonic> i did not complete it 
[02:49] <the_sonic> (joking)
[02:50] <the_sonic> at the time i remember thinking i wish this was how mmorpgs were
[02:50] <the_shpuld> honestly I couldn't get into any mmorpgs
[02:50] <the_shpuld> I played morrowind first
[02:50] <the_shpuld> and it set expectations for an open world rpg
[02:51] <the_sonic> :/
[02:51] <the_sonic> i tried to play everquest before i'd even played an rpg before
[02:52] <the_shpuld> yeah I didn't have a connection for that nor a pc for that
[02:52] <the_sonic> best thing about that experience was being genuinely scared of higher lvl mobs
[02:52] <the_shpuld> I really like that in rpgs
[02:52] <the_shpuld> fucking oblivion
[02:52] <the_shpuld> took that away
[02:52] <the_shpuld> one of the best thing
[02:52] <the_shpuld> and no
[02:52] <the_sonic> pretty much sure that was the first open world style game i had played.. apart from top down style 
[02:53] <the_sonic> awww man, obv could have been so cool if it'd had those kind of zones 
[02:53] <the_sonic> no auto leveling 
[02:53] <the_shpuld> what better way of encouraging player to level up and become stronger than blocking off interesting areas with dangerous things
[02:53] <the_shpuld> gothic did it really good
[02:53] <the_shpuld> that game is totes amazeballs
[02:54] <the_shpuld> played it for the first time just a few years ago
[02:54] <the_shpuld> it does so many things so well
[02:54] <the_shpuld> and it's an early 3d open world rpg
[02:54] <the_shpuld> and just like morrowind, it's not generic shit
[02:54] <the_sonic> wish they'd copy these awesome things and put them into modern rpgs :/
[02:54] <the_shpuld> naaah
[02:55] <the_shpuld> skyrim sold better than morrowind and gothic
[02:55] <the_shpuld> that's the new direction
[02:55] <the_shpuld> generic nordic culture and super shallow everything
[02:56] <the_sonic> borderlands loot mechanic + fallout 4
[02:56] <the_sonic> =
[02:56] <the_sonic> oh yeah
[02:56] <the_sonic> that's my game
[02:56] <the_shpuld> borderlands was cool because it made the grinding/questing kinda fun
[02:56] <the_sonic> borderlands yes!
[02:57] <the_sonic> borderlands 2
[02:57] <the_sonic> bullet sponge
[02:57] <the_shpuld> as soon as you disable mouse smoothing and increase fov, borderlands is fun
[02:57] <the_sonic> i played borderlands on xbox 360
[02:57] <the_shpuld> also, if I play alone, I like to turn up the difficulty with a 3rd party program
[02:57] <the_sonic> then on ps3
[02:57] <the_shpuld> which makes some things a bit bulletsponge, but makes it hard as balls as well
[02:58] <the_shpuld> so you won't be overleveled if you do all sidemissions
[02:58] <the_sonic> i can't even begin to imagine how much i'd enjoy it on pc
[02:58] <the_shpuld> unlike with normal difficulty
[02:58] <the_sonic> too much
[02:58] <the_shpuld> let's see, borderlands 2: 11 hours
[02:58] <the_shpuld> borderlands: 149 hours
[02:58] <the_shpuld> :s
[03:00] <the_sonic> lul
[03:01] <the_sonic> want to play borderlands coop sometime?
[03:01] <the_shpuld> do you have it on steam
[03:01] <the_sonic> i'm actually going to buy it 
[03:02] <the_sonic> i want to play it sp
[03:02] <the_shpuld> yeah I'll play with you if you get it
[03:02] <hauer> Obama works at the White House.
[03:02] <hauer> hmm
[03:03] <the_sonic> aight
[03:03] <the_sonic> as long as it runs on 64 8.1
[03:04] <the_shpuld> it does
[03:04] <the_shpuld> that's what I'm running
[03:04] <the_shpuld> I can link you to the mouse smoothing fix as well
[03:04] <the_shpuld> because it's fucking hard to play with smoothing on
[03:05] <the_sonic> Buy Borderlands: Game of the Year
[03:05] <the_sonic> this?
[03:05] <the_sonic> ye, i just read the descriptions
[03:06] <the_sonic> oh wait though
[03:06] <the_shpuld> yeah that's the version with all the dlc
[03:06] <the_sonic> some of the dlc was super spongey :/ 
[03:07] <the_sonic> when i downloaded it for xbox
[03:07] <the_shpuld> I never played most of them
[03:07] <the_shpuld> but I still have them all
[03:07] <the_shpuld> zombie island was fun enough
[03:07] * dem0n has joined #125fps
[03:07] <the_sonic> prob be fine cool
[03:07] <the_shpuld> mad moxxi's underdome riot was cool for some hours
[03:07] <the_shpuld> the other 2 actual long expansions I barely played
[03:07] <the_shpuld> because I was playing alone
[03:08] <the_shpuld> and my pc at the time could barely run the areas
[03:09] <the_sonic> i'll just install without dlc first 
[03:09] <the_sonic> when i quit f4
[03:10] <the_sonic> that's all i want to play anyway
[03:11] <the_sonic> i rember installing b2 and hating the sponges
[03:11] <the_sonic> "man there's gotta be a console for this shit"
[03:11] <the_shpuld> bl1 has its own share of sponges mostly for some bosses
[03:12] <the_sonic> i was fine on the consoles
[03:12] <the_sonic> it was fair
[03:12] <the_shpuld> but I think it still stands in its own well
[03:12] <the_sonic> some were sponges 'cause they had leet armour recharge
[03:13] <the_sonic> b2 all enemies had that 
[03:13] <the_shpuld> :v
[03:13] <the_sonic> i don't mind working on a leet enemy 
[03:13] <the_shpuld> I didn't like the way bl2 tried to be funny
[03:13] * Patrol1985 has quit IRC (Signed off)
[03:13] <the_shpuld> felt so forced
[03:14] <the_shpuld> and including (at the time) years old internet memes didn't help
[03:14] <the_shpuld> bl1 was wacky but it was relatively consistent and didn't try too hard
[03:15] <the_shpuld> it had plenty of movie references in the names of characters and some quests
[03:15] <the_shpuld> and some things were just silly
[03:15] <the_shpuld> and that as good
[03:15] <the_sonic> man
[03:15] <the_sonic> if only it was just that for me
[03:15] <the_sonic> i loved the way the guns felt
[03:15] <the_shpuld> bl2 gunplay felt the same to me as bl1
[03:15] <the_sonic> i just couldn't hack the way enemies recharged shield
[03:15] <the_shpuld> loot system was worse though
[03:16] <the_shpuld> and also none of the characters I tried had really fun abilities
[03:16] <the_sonic> it was not the same game
[03:16] <the_sonic> i can fuckin point gun at enemy and hit 100% it's not my end
[03:16] <the_sonic> that's why i like a lot of console games
[03:17] <the_sonic> 'cause gamepad makes aiming dreadful
[03:17] <the_shpuld> these games make you not hit 100% because of gun spread and enemy animations that are not linear
[03:17] <the_shpuld> so the difference between mouse vs controller aim is not gonna be that huge
[03:17] <the_sonic> but i'm hitting bl2 enemies on pc with 100% accuracy, they just insta recharge when i need to reload.. wtf
[03:18] <the_sonic> ughhhhhhhhh
[03:18] <the_sonic> i am ughing irl
[03:18] <the_sonic> and i just foun a new vault in f4 so
[03:18] <the_sonic> that takes a lot
[03:18] <the_sonic> borderlands 1 is leet as fuck
[03:19] <the_sonic> i just want to focus on that
[03:19] <the_shpuld> also the music was cool
[03:19] <the_shpuld> very chill
[03:19] <the_shpuld> some of the tracks are kinda burned into my brain because of idling when waiting for mate to eat dinner or something
[03:19] <the_shpuld> or just grinding
[03:21] <the_sonic> ye
[03:21] <the_sonic> in borderlands2 i didnt't mind grinding
[03:21] <the_sonic> just the genuine bullet sponges
[03:22] <the_sonic> in bl2
[03:22] <the_shpuld> I didn't play that game enough to get into any kind of grinding or anything
[03:22] <the_shpuld> just progressing with a normal pace until it felt dull
[03:23] <the_sonic> well how far did you get
[03:23] <the_sonic> i barely got out of what i assumed was the tutorial zone
[03:23] <the_shpuld> 11 hours, can't remember where I was in the game
[03:23] <the_shpuld> and I don't really care
[03:23] <the_sonic> fucking hell
[03:23] <the_shpuld> played it like on 3 different occasions, once with a friend
[03:23] <the_sonic> i was like 2hrs in before i thought this can fuck right off
[03:23] <the_sonic> and i tried twice
[03:24] <the_shpuld> I fought through the obvious starter area
[03:24] * dem0n has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[03:24] <the_sonic> 11hrs
[03:24] <the_shpuld> but the game didn't kick off after that
[03:24] <the_sonic> fuck is wrong with you
[03:24] <the_shpuld> :V
[03:24] <the_shpuld> that's what steam says
[03:24] <the_sonic> i don't believe it
[03:24] <the_sonic> i just thought it wasn't the same game in the first couple of hours
[03:25] <the_shpuld> mane
[03:25] <the_sonic> first hour of bl1 i was like "i'm gonna play this all day until i complete it"
[03:25] <the_shpuld> I hadn't played the first game in a long time when I tried the second one
[03:25] <the_shpuld> then after getting fed up with the second one I thought I just didn't like the games anymore
[03:25] <the_sonic> it was that addictive

[00:00] <the_sonic> i'm trying not to think about peepole trying to start ww3
[00:00] <the_sonic> too depressing 
[00:00] <funnyb> its about time, russia has been invading swedish and norwegian air-space for years
[00:00] <funnyb> and they refuse to give a reason to why
[00:00] <funnyb> i say good for you turkey
[00:02] <the_shpuld> well, it's clear why russians were invading the airspace there
[00:02] <funnyb> if what turkey claims is true though, theres no reason for the russian plane to ignore the contact attempts
[00:02] <funnyb> especially 10 of them
[00:02] <the_shpuld> and they were invading it for around 30 seconds to go through a < 3km distance
[00:02] <xou|> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dbbi81KqU
[00:02] <the_shpuld> they crossed it twice
[00:02] <funnyb> all-star match right there
[00:02] <the_shpuld> since they made a loop
[00:03] <the_shpuld> and 2nd time they got shot at
[00:03] <funnyb> turkey claims to have been trying to contact them 10 times for a 5 minute period though
[00:03] <funnyb> and with no response, i wouldnt trust the russians either
[00:03] <the_shpuld> that's what they claim
[00:03] <funnyb> exactly
[00:03] <the_shpuld> I wouldn't trust anyone
[00:03] <funnyb> if its true they should be able to back these claims up to nato
[00:03] <the_shpuld> I saw the flight paths drawn on a map
[00:03] <the_shpuld> with the crashing sites
[00:03] <the_shpuld> turkey being in the nato is the worst part of this
[00:05] <funnyb> ye its gonna be interestin to see how this pans out
[00:05] * Vaskebjorn has joined #125fps
[00:05] <the_shpuld> for once i'm glad we're not in nato
[00:05] <funnyb> but the whole point of me mentioning they've invaded airspace before, is that they must start to respect it
[00:05] <funnyb> we could've brought down several planes by now if we werent pussies
[00:05] <the_shpuld> yeah, maybe one day
[00:05] <xou|> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs5hn-_D9-M
[00:05] <xou|> true allstar
[00:06] <the_shpuld> shooting a plane down for just going past an airspace is not the smartest course of action in any case
[00:06] <funnyb> y u hef to do that xou

[00:06] <funnyb> true shpuld, but somewhere someone has to draw a line
[00:06] <funnyb> russia cant act like they can do anything they wnat
[00:07] <funnyb> not saying this is the way to go, but its inevidable in a long run
[00:07] <the_shpuld> you shouldn't draw the line by shooting them down, and then have the pilots shot at when they're parachuting
[00:07] <funnyb> when they keep doing shit like this
[00:07] <funnyb> true
[00:07] <the_shpuld> (geneve conventions anyone?)
[00:07] <the_shpuld> that wasn't turks shooting them though
[00:07] <the_shpuld> that was FSA

[00:07] <the_shpuld> free syrian army, iirc

[01:01] <the_sonic> man, i dunno what to do.. this is what i like about these games
[01:02] <the_sonic> i cleared some old buildings, made a couple of prefabs
[01:02] <the_sonic> with some beds
[01:02] <the_sonic> added food/water
[01:02] <the_sonic> they still sidetalk me like i didn't just save their entire lives
[01:02] <funnyb> i gave them four beds, outside, in the fucking rain
[01:03] <funnyb> and cleared the buildings that you could ye, nice cheap material
[01:03] <the_sonic> lolololol

[02:59] <the_sonic> :o
[02:59] <the_shpuld> samsung gear vr needs an expensive phone
[02:59] <the_shpuld> and oculus needs the device itself
[02:59] <the_shpuld> and oculus rift isn't out properly
[02:59] <the_sonic> it'll pay off in the end
[02:59] <the_sonic> to get in early
[03:00] <the_shpuld> I just want a proper consumer version, instead of a shoddy early edition
[03:00] <the_shpuld> with gear vr I think the target audience might be larger
[03:00] <the_shpuld> but it's not quite feature rich as the or
[03:01] <the_shpuld> and the valve thing is mostly just weird
[03:02] <the_sonic> if it's gonna be "the next big thing" it's worth it
[03:02] <the_shpuld> I don't think it will be, but it will be a great novelty thing

[18:19] <hauer> They should prohibit such things.
[18:19] <funnyb> hey shut your whore mouth
[18:19] <funnyb> we just need to stricten laws for fattys
[18:19] <the_sonic> :s
[18:19] <funnyb> no using public transportation, no talking to people without being spoken to first
[18:19] <the_shpuld> did someone say... FAT TAX?
[18:20] <the_sonic> lolol

[18:20] <the_sonic> b-b-b-but
[18:20] <funnyb> curves arent supposed to be 100% fat
[18:20] <the_sonic> MUH GENETIX
[18:20] <hauer> die cis scum
[18:20] <the_shpuld> CHECK YOUR THIN PRIVILEGE
[18:20] <hauer> Curves or full bodies women means fatty blobbernaught today.
[18:21] <the_shpuld> depends on who you're asking
[18:21] <hauer> Looks like a couch = curves.
[18:21] <the_shpuld> fortunately most people are still sane
[18:22] <funnyb> doesnt matter what most people think, we just need sane people in charge
[18:22] <the_shpuld> yeah sweden and US
[18:22] <the_shpuld> get your crap together
[18:22] <funnyb> getting the gastric bypass surgery without being superduperfat will cost a person around 85,000 SEK
[18:22] <funnyb> can i have that in my pocket since im just not fat pls
[18:23] <hauer> Let's share a 6-pack.
[18:23] <hauer> It's only 15 kr.
[18:23] <hauer> Right?
[18:24] <funnyb> in fantasyland, yeah
[18:24] <hauer> Maybe buy the more expensive Royal X-Mas beer.
[18:24] <hauer> 3 kr a bottle.
[18:24] <funnyb> i never buy sixpacks, they dont sell strong beer in sixpacks over here
[18:24] <funnyb> either buy them loose or buy a plate of 24
[18:24] <funnyb> plate?
[18:24] <funnyb> hm
[18:25] <hauer> I buy a crate with 30 bottles.
[18:25] <funnyb> crate!
[18:25] <hauer> 24 is only for cans.
[18:25] <funnyb> i buy cans mostly
[18:25] <funnyb> i prefer bottles, but usually costs more
[18:25] <the_shpuld> 24 cans = case
[18:25] <hauer> http://www.sjobeck.dk/files/manager/tuborg/tuborgkasse30stk.jpg
[18:25] <funnyb> case. nice.
[18:25] <hauer> 24 cans cost the same as 30 bottles here.

[18:26] <hauer> You collect cans and bottles in parks?
[18:26] <hauer> Like a hobo.
[18:26] <funnyb> pls, i dont even recycle my own
[18:26] <funnyb> too much work
[18:26] <funnyb> i throw them away
[18:26] <hauer> :<
[18:26] <hauer> I always return them.
[18:27] <hauer> Even cans.
[18:27] <funnyb> im not as responsible
[18:27] <funnyb> sadly
[18:29] <the_shpuld> I just put empty cans in the cupboard
[18:29] <the_shpuld> and when I can't fit any more, I put them in bags and get money
[18:30] <funnyb> i just scrap them for the aluminum. #justfalloutthings
[18:30] <hauer> Maybe I should buy a box of wine.
[18:30] * magic|def has joined #125fps
[18:30] <hauer> So goddamn expensive.
[18:30] <hauer> 95 kr.
[18:30] <funnyb> red wine?
[18:30] <the_shpuld> 15 cents per returned can here
[18:30] <the_shpuld> so getting that 5-10 euros occasionally is nice
[18:31] <funnyb> 10 euros? so one beer?
[18:31] <funnyb> #justswedenthings
[18:31] <the_shpuld> ))
[18:31] <hauer> Maybe buy some cheap wine from Chile. 25 kr/bottle
[18:32] <funnyb> the only time i bought wine was when i was still in school
[18:32] <funnyb> and had no money
[18:32] <hauer> Euro is a pretty gay currency.
[18:32] <funnyb> because ye, 3litres for like 50sek? damn yes
[18:32] <hauer> You dont have to pee as much.
[18:32] <hauer> Whisky is even better.
[18:32] <funnyb> im too much of a pussy, i dislike most whiskys
[18:32] <funnyb> there are some i love, but most i dislike
[18:34] <hauer> I like the peaty and smoky ones.
[18:34] <hauer> But to get a buzz on I just drink the cheap crap.

[18:39] <hauer> They made that one in quarter cask and in 40 % too.
[18:39] <hauer> Those are like 400 kr and 275 kr.
[18:39] <hauer> The cheap 40 % alc. for 275 is great as well.
[18:39] <funnyb> thats more reasonable ye
[18:40] <hauer> rofl Im on bolaget's website. I thought it was very good prices.
[18:40] <hauer> But it's half a bottle.

[21:42] <flair> you can get a base up quicker
[21:42] <xou|> no more 3 hours for a bo3
[21:42] <flair> -.-
[21:42] <funnyb> i cant see that being popular among the sc2 community though
[21:42] <funnyb> having played it since sc:bw, you're pretty used to the slow games
[21:43] <flair> there are still some 30 minute games
[21:43] <flair> but nothing crazy anymore. sc2 changes that a bit but lotv even  more so. I bet there are a lot of players who disagree with it :x

[00:23] <funnyb> and on lower tier games, soo much weird throwing going on
[00:23] <funnyb> which is understandable
[00:24] <xou|> why is it understandable ?
[00:26] <funnyb> because they try so hard to make it in cs, but after years of trying they surely realise they never will

[23:33] <the_sonic> 1337
[23:33] <the_sonic> it is a warm hat
[23:34] <the_shpuld> I have one beanie
[23:34] <the_shpuld> that my mum made
[23:34] <the_sonic> noice
[23:34] <the_sonic> does it have a bobble on the top
[23:34] <amOKchen> 7,1(0,17,10,17,1)

[23:34] <the_shpuld> no
[23:35] <the_sonic> if i lived in finland i'd probably wear a beanie all the time
[23:35] <the_sonic> it's too cold here to not wear a hat and it's not even snowing 
[23:35] <flair> beanies are dope
[23:35] <the_shpuld> I only wear it outside if I need to walk longer than my school trip
[23:37] <the_sonic> b e a n i e 
[23:38] <the_sonic> let's see the beanie, the_shpuld
[23:38] <the_sonic> perhaps you could wear it next shpuldlive
[23:38] <the_shpuld> I once had it on when starting stream
[23:38] <the_sonic> with headphones
[23:38] <the_sonic> I MISSED IT
[23:39] <the_sonic> fffuuuu
[23:40] <the_sonic> man
[23:40] <the_sonic> these enemies on hard mode
[23:40] <the_sonic> bit spongey
[23:40] <the_shpuld> SSSHHHHBONGEY
[23:40] <the_sonic> been ok up to this point 
[23:41] <the_sonic> not even that bothered by sponges
[23:41] <the_shpuld> oh yeah that was a problem in skyrim, felt too easy on normal, everything just took a lot of hits on hard
[23:41] <the_sonic> as long as they don't recharge shields like bl2
[23:41] * the_shpuld smashes furniture
[23:41] <the_sonic> that's all they've done here too :s
[23:42] * the_shpuld tears the wallpapers
[23:42] * the_shpuld writes angry messages on irc
[23:42] <the_sonic> gnashing of teeth 
[23:42] * the_shpuld gets triggered
[23:42] <the_shpuld> stop oppressing me the_sonic 
[23:43] <the_sonic> rage ai changed with difficulty, was pretty cool
[23:43] <the_sonic> shuffling around at speed on hard mode
[23:43] <the_shpuld> best way is the quake way
[23:43] <the_sonic> moving slow on easy
[23:43] <the_shpuld> rules are the same, enemy placement is different
[23:43] <the_shpuld> except in quake nightmare mode
[23:43] <the_shpuld> enemies shoot twice as fast
[23:43] <the_shpuld> that was actually cool
[23:43] <the_sonic> fucking dreadful bulletsponges on later levels though, ruined the game for me
[23:43] <the_sonic> that sounds better
[23:44] <the_shpuld> don't make enemies take more damage
[23:44] <the_shpuld> make them deal more damage
[23:44] <the_shpuld> in some games that doesn't work though
[23:44] <flair> ^
[23:44] <the_sonic> that's how it should be done :s
[23:44] <the_shpuld> since getting killed with one hit is cheap as fuck
[23:45] <the_shpuld> in quake it works because you can play the game without getting hit
[23:45] <the_shpuld> you wont be able to play a cod singleplayer without getting hit
[23:45] <the_shpuld> hitscan everywhere
[23:45] <the_shpuld> respawning enemies
[23:48] <the_sonic> oh man
[23:48] <the_sonic> talking of quake
[23:48] <the_sonic> i dread to think how dreadful i am at aiming now
[23:49] <flair> riding a bike, mlg 2016
[23:49] <the_sonic> i think in the past why i can not play for a year then hit 45% after a bit of practice i's 'cause i've only played fps on consoles

[21:38] <hauer> Just ate a whole herring.
[21:38] <hauer> No bulgur can bring me down.
[21:38] <the_shpuld> there's a few places I've been into where you have options for more kebab instead of having rice, french fries, etc
[21:39] <hauer> I've only seen kebab with french fries around here.
[21:39] <hauer> Maybe that's why I never get it.
[21:39] <the_shpuld> I prefer rice with my kebab tbh
[21:39] <hauer> I prefer a steak.
[21:39] <the_shpuld> me too, but that's not fast food
[21:39] <hauer> You can get that in the same places.
[21:40] <hauer> Poor cuts.
[21:40] <funnyb> the place i were at, they do offer steak, but the steak they give you.. pls no.
[21:40] <hauer> But still a whole piece of meat.
[21:40] <the_shpuld> steaks in kebab places....
[21:40] <the_shpuld> no
[21:40] <the_shpuld> just
[21:40] <the_shpuld> no

[15:23] <funnyb> In the 17th century, Morgan was a feared privateer. Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran dangerous missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing Spanish prisoners in Cuba and raiding Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He then held the entire city of Portobelo, Panama for ransom after plundering the Cuban coast. His pillaging career didnt come to an end until Spain 
[15:23] <funnyb> and England signed a peace treaty in 1671. Instead of being punished for his overseas antics, Morgan became a knight and lieutenant governor of Jamaica.

[19:33] <the_shpuld> little known fact, the_sonic is afraid of the dark
[19:33] <the_shpuld> because when it's dark, it's harder to see skullman rising
[19:33] <the_sonic> as i'm going for it i realise i can't actually see anything

[20:23] <funnyb> [15:36] <funnyb> i got like 12k right now
[20:24] <the_sonic> dayum
[20:24] <the_sonic> buy fuckloads of ammo?
[20:24] <SMShpuld> does anyone sell skulls in the game?
[20:24] <the_sonic> i only have about 6k but that's only 'cause the pussy traders don't have enough ammo for me to buy
[20:25] <the_sonic> actually, good idea
[20:25] <the_sonic> that is wat i will do before i go out
[20:25] <the_sonic> fast travel to different traders and buy all their ammo
[20:26] <the_sonic> wish some traders actually had interesting items to buy too
[20:26] <the_sonic> some super mega expensive items

[20:53] <the_nsx> best lulzfone
[20:53] <SMShpuld> I kinda need to upgrade my phone but I kinda can't be arsed
[20:53] <the_nsx> like upgrade the_OS or new fone?
[20:53] <SMShpuld> some of the basic call functionality doesn't work quite perfect ))
[20:54] <SMShpuld> but it's not like anyone ever calls me
[20:54] <the_nsx> ((((
[20:54] <the_nsx> i'll call you
[20:54] <the_nsx> hard
[20:54] <the_nsx> so
[20:54] <the_nsx> hard
[20:54] <SMShpuld> sometimes I can barely hear them and they can barely hear me
[20:54] <SMShpuld> and I need to enable loudspeaker to continue
[20:54] <the_nsx> =|
[20:54] <SMShpuld> but yeah
[20:55] <SMShpuld> I'm kinda interested in s6/s6edge/s6edge+/note5
[20:55] <SMShpuld> because sumseng gear vr
[20:55] <SMShpuld> I want to dev for vr
[20:55] <the_nsx> :o
[20:55] <SMShpuld> but shit's expensive
[20:55] <SMShpuld> and not sure if worth it
[20:55] <the_nsx> it's still pretty new
[20:55] <the_nsx> so
[20:55] <the_nsx> mebi next year
[20:55] <SMShpuld> the vr itself is chepe
[20:55] <SMShpuld> but phone is expensive
[20:55] <SMShpuld> since phone contains the screen and hardware
[20:56] <the_nsx> s6 is like 500
[20:56] <SMShpuld> more like 600
[20:56] <the_nsx> =(
[20:57] <SMShpuld> I could just wait for oculus to come out
[20:57] <SMShpuld> and get that for 300
[20:57] <SMShpuld> and get better quality VR and a more familiar platform
[20:57] <the_nsx> Samsung Galaxy S6 32 Go - 435.99
[20:57] <the_nsx> Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge 32 Go - 528.50
[20:57] <SMShpuld> but the uniform target audience with gear vr is interesting
[20:57] <SMShpuld> that's pretty cheap
[20:57] <SMShpuld> I was looking at finnish stores and it was more expensive
[20:58] <the_nsx> well that was an online sale 
[20:58] <the_nsx> black friday or smth
[20:58] <the_nsx> could be back at that price for xmas

[21:40] <funnyb> but
[21:40] <funnyb> i know he has offered to do it for many years
[21:41] <funnyb> and now, the fact that my brother wants his cat back after it living with my father for a few weeks
[21:41] <funnyb> is a problem?
[21:41] <funnyb> a big problem?
[21:41] <funnyb> huehuehue

[14:37] <xou|> if you like to live with 800 per month
[14:37] <xou|> which isn't much for finland I guess
[14:38] <the_shpuld> dude
[14:38] <the_shpuld> I live with < 500 euros per month now
[14:38] <xou|> in Finland ?
[14:38] <the_shpuld> yes
[14:38] <xou|> when do you drink alcohol ?
[14:39] <the_shpuld> rarely tbh
[14:39] <the_shpuld> and avoiding clubs that are super expensive
[14:39] <xou|> you can't be finnish, truly
[14:39] <xou|> :)
[14:40] <the_shpuld> I could just keep buying cheap booze
[14:40] <the_shpuld> and get drunk off that twice a week
[14:40] <xou|> I doubt you'd want to spend your life with that budget, right?
[14:41] <the_shpuld> on a 500 eur budget, of course not
[14:41] <the_shpuld> 800 sounds much better
[14:41] <xou|> UPGRADE IN PROGRESS
[14:42] <the_shpuld> and with this 500 I still need to make sure I keep earning enough student credit
[14:42] <the_shpuld> and I don't get it during summer either
