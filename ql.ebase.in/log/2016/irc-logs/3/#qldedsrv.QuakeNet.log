[20:30] <lonewulf_> Going through quakelive.focus log (Steam release time) .. read this and LOL
[20:30] <lonewulf_> 18:13 8/<g gPredatH0rg8/>g emy windows server is running the whole day without issues so far
[20:30] * Rick971_ has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:31] <lonewulf_> This was around the time of all the Linux qlds crashes.
[20:31] * Rick971_ has joined #qldedsrv
[20:31] <lonewulf_> heh
[20:31] <vtchill> anyone know of documentation describing every config var that can be set in either server.cfg or on the exec line (e.g. +set fs_homepath)
[20:32] <lonewulf_> I wish..that would be gold.
[20:33] <McAfee> we need to turn sponge into a singularity, then we will have all the knowledge xD
[20:33] <lonewulf_> lol
[20:34] <McAfee> but this is a start: http://www.regurge.at/ql/
[20:34] <McAfee> http://www.holysh1t.net/quake-live-commands-list/
[20:34] <sponge-> listcvars *
[20:35] <sponge-> but there's just a lot of shit that was in q3 and doesn't do anything in ql
[20:35] * Oh`Christ`Off is now known as Oh`Christ
[20:35] <vtchill> yea exactly, i just want to know what is relative to the server config without everything else
[20:35] <lonewulf_> terminal history too short for listcvars*
[20:35] <vtchill> especially without all the cvars that do nothing
[20:35] <McAfee> didnt the wolfet version of listcvars and listcmds have comments in the output ?
[20:35] <sponge-> look at g_, pmove_, weapon_, and sv_
[20:35] <vtchill> any easy way to print this list out from console/
[20:36] <sponge-> logfile 2
[20:36] <sponge-> and then run the cmd
[20:36] <McAfee> you could also run the command 26 times: listcvars a*    .... listcvars z*
[20:37] <lonewulf_> Thats what I did the other night ^^
[20:38] <McAfee> but yeah i think wolfet, or either etqw, had comments when outputing cvars
[20:38] <sponge-> that was tech 4
[20:38] <McAfee> :)
[20:38] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[20:40] <sponge-> when it comes down to it i dont even know what all the cvars do and its not even apparent in the code sometimes
[20:40] <sponge-> and then theres stuff like disable_* which aren't registered cvars at all
[20:41] <McAfee> yeah but if we turn you into a singularity, there's stuff you know that you are not aware you know :P
[20:41] <lonewulf_> we may never know all the definitions to listcvars* :((
[20:43] <lonewulf_> quake is the most mysterious game ever.
[20:43] * Rick971_ has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[20:45] <McAfee> Was it ALL Carmack as far as cvars go back then quake3 was released?
[20:46] <McAfee> when*
[20:47] <McAfee> and John Cash, accoridng to the credits... don't think i remember him
[20:50] <roast> i remember johnny cash
[20:51] <McAfee> http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1063/
[20:52] <Drayan> that's quite a CV
[20:55] <lonewulf_> High pings today on servers
[20:55] * lonewulf_ wonders if its only him
[20:55] <lonewulf_> time too restart vps I suppose.

[22:42] <lonewulf> My ping to my Chicago servers (this has been like this all day so far) have gone from 30 ping to 130ping
[22:42] <lonewulf> for me.
[22:42] <lonewulf> would this be an issue w/my vps, or my actual isp?
[22:42] <lonewulf> my isp right?
[22:43] <carmethene> traceroute it?
[22:43] <lonewulf> trying to figure out who to contact, my isp, or the vps Im using for qlds.
[22:43] <carmethene> traceroute it
[22:43] <lonewulf> kk
[22:43] <lonewulf> thanks
[22:43] <carmethene> hopefully you will see the ping jump suddenly during one of the hops
[22:44] <carmethene> or maybe you'll just see your packets taking a ridiculous route
[22:44] <lonewulf> I think its on my end (my isp).. because all the low ping servers that I would normally connect too, are now well over a 100 ping.
[22:44] <lonewulf> let me google traceroute
[22:44] <lonewulf> xD
[22:44] <carmethene> sounds that way, but traceroute will give you more concrete info
[22:44] <carmethene> are you on windows or linux?
[22:45] <carmethene> I'm guessing the former?
[22:45] <lonewulf> kk thank you sir
[22:45] <carmethene> open cmd.exe, tracert www.google.com
[22:45] <carmethene> or such
[22:45] <lonewulf> kk
[22:45] <lonewulf> currently on win7
[22:45] <lonewulf> using PuTTY
[22:45] <lonewulf> lol
[22:45] <carmethene> nothing wrong with that
[22:45] * crobartie has quit IRC (Signed off)
[22:45] <lonewulf> but I play from win7, so yeah.
[22:46] <lonewulf> I prefer to be in my Arch Linux install tho
[22:46] <lonewulf> :D
[22:46] <carmethene> I'm stuck in Windows land too
[22:46] <carmethene> Cygwin to the rescue
[22:46] <lonewulf> but no Linux client for ql.
[22:46] <lonewulf> lol
[22:46] <lonewulf> cool
[22:46] <lonewulf> I've used Cygwin before.
[22:46] <carmethene> mostly Cygwin or Chrome Mosh to my Debian workstation
[22:47] <lonewulf> Very nice!
[22:47] <carmethene> it's a great compromise :)
[22:47] <carmethene> just need to figure out how to get PulseAudio working over SSH and I'm done
[22:49] <lonewulf> gl with that.
[22:50] <lonewulf> thought I had notes on that..
[22:50] <lonewulf> just checked, and was about 
[22:50] <lonewulf> scp
[22:50] <lonewulf> # Copy files from a remote server to your local computer.
[22:50] <lonewulf> That wont help you any ^
[22:50] <lonewulf> :o
[22:51] <carmethene> ah I know roughly how to do it, just need to sit down and figure out the details
[22:51] <lonewulf> ah, the fun part!
[22:51] <lonewulf> :D
[22:51] <carmethene> you can expose the audio hardware as a port
[22:52] <carmethene> then on the remote client, you point at the port, et voila, remote audio, just like remote X
[22:52] <carmethene> but obviously you don't want your audio hardware sitting open on the network, so there's some ssh tunnelling involved, etc
[22:52] <carmethene> anyhow, any luck with the traceroute?
[22:52] <lonewulf> trying now
[22:54] <lonewulf> 'traceroute' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
[22:54] <lonewulf> operable program or batch file.
[22:54] <lonewulf> stupid windows command prompt.
[22:54] <Drayan> tracert
[22:54] <lonewulf> kk ty
[22:55] <carmethene> 11:45 < carmethene> open cmd.exe, tracert www.google.com
[22:55] <lonewulf> I put my actual ip to my qlds in.
[22:55] <lonewulf> :o
[22:55] <carmethene> even bettr
[22:56] <lonewulf> Trace complete.
[22:56] <carmethene> anything obvious with the timings?
[22:57] <lonewulf> goes from 1 ms to 17 to 30 to 127
[22:57] <carmethene> that last one sounds pretty egregious
[22:57] <carmethene> try some other sites, find a pattern
[22:57] <carmethene> see if you can identify a specific hop where it goes up
[22:57] <carmethene> that should tell you who you need to contact
[22:57] <lonewulf> kk
[22:57] <carmethene> if it's right at the start, it's your local network
[22:57] <carmethene> just outside that, your ISP
[22:58] <lonewulf> over a maximum of 30 hops:
[22:58] <carmethene> on the far end, it's probably the target machine
[22:58] <lonewulf> its says.
[22:58] <carmethene> etc
[22:58] <carmethene> also doing a few passes helps
[22:58] <lonewulf> Roger that~
[22:58] <carmethene> sometimes the large hop is temporary
[22:58] <lonewulf> kk
[22:58] <carmethene> e.g. 4,5,3,4,5,2000,2,4
[22:59] <carmethene> which implies some amount of packet loss, or routing insanity
[22:59] <lonewulf> its my isp
[22:59] <carmethene> I had a case where the spike was moving around all over the traceroute
[22:59] <lonewulf> the 127 jump is in a town very close to me
[22:59] <carmethene> turned out to be faulty hardware right outside the house
[22:59] <lonewulf> very close = a couple miles away.
[22:59] <carmethene> there you go then
[23:00] <lonewulf> :D
[23:00] <carmethene> what's your server ip btw?
[23:00] <carmethene> I'll tell you what I'm pinging to it
[23:00] <lonewulf> 45.63.70.118:27960-2
[23:00] <lonewulf> Im running 3 duel servers
[23:00] <lonewulf> classic
[23:00] <carmethene> steady 80ms-ish
[23:01] <lonewulf> is that good for you?
[23:01] <lonewulf> server is in Chicago
[23:01] <carmethene> for Chicago?  Yeah I guess so
[23:01] <carmethene> I'm in San Francisco
[23:01] <lonewulf> kk cool
[23:01] <lonewulf> ah
[23:01] <lonewulf> thats great for you then
[23:01] <lonewulf> :p
[23:02] <carmethene> :)
[23:02] <lonewulf> well, calling the ISP
[23:02] <lonewulf> Maybe I'll get lucky and get a gamer tech help person.. and he/she will give me better routing around the World.!
[23:02] <lonewulf> :))
[23:03] <carmethene> heh
[23:03] <carmethene> it happens
[23:03] <carmethene> our local Comcast office is amazeballs
[23:03] <lonewulf> :o
[23:04] <[ByQ]Descent> try us-1.ql.ebase.in - its in Chicago too...
[23:04] <carmethene> me or him?
[23:05] <lonewulf> I usually ping low 20s there [ByQ]Descent.
[23:05] <lonewulf> its well over a 100 as well.
[23:05] <carmethene> high 80s
[23:05] <carmethene> much the same as lonewulf's
[23:05] * vtchill has quit IRC (Signed off)
[23:05] <lonewulf> :D
[23:06] <[ByQ]Descent> traceroute ...
[23:06] <[ByQ]Descent> linux: top
[23:06] <lonewulf> I was in Steam Server Browser when I noticed the hight pings to Chicago. (was like this server browser sucks)
[23:07] <lonewulf> s/hight/high
[23:09] <lonewulf> Not! Its my ISP that sucks!
[23:09] <lonewulf> heh
[23:10] <roast> have you tried closing your goat porn torrents
[23:10] <[ByQ]Descent> ..for sure it helps ..
[23:11] <lonewulf> lol
[23:11] <lonewulf> I dont torrent
[23:11] <roast> close your goat porn usenet downloads
[23:12] <lonewulf> lol
[23:13] <[ByQ]Descent> :D
[23:15] <lonewulf> Just glad its on my end (ISP)
[23:16] <lonewulf> knowing that I can leave my servers up
[23:16] <lonewulf> would have hated a regular user joined and had horrible ping. (they might not reconnect in the future)
[23:16] <lonewulf> :D
[23:16] <lonewulf> had it been vultr.com (vps Im using)
[23:17] <lonewulf> Im watching them like a hawk..
[23:18] <[ByQ]Descent> other users have ping issues or not?
[23:18] <lonewulf> Also, found a way to install Arch GNU/Linux on DO now too.
[23:18] <lonewulf> :D

[23:28] <McAfee> fyi @ traceroute, some servers ignore ICMP, others reply with a lower priority, so some hops will always report a high ping, but the next hop is normal again.
[23:29] <McAfee> you did sort of cover it when you said it was temporary
[23:30] <McAfee> but it's more like permanently configured to not give a good reply.

[00:39] <tjone270_> g_voteFlags 8 is the cvar that will disable that. 
[00:40] <NOR> ok, tryed that i server.cfg but I could still vote .. But i'm admin :) ?
[00:40] <tjone270_> You'll also need to make sure your map-pool doesn't contain modes outside of the ones you'd like to run.
[00:40] <tjone270_> Admins bypass vote flags.

[00:59] <tjone270_> Ahoy :)
[00:59] <NOR> Some tips / hints about running the run_xxx as an daemon or...
[01:00] <NOR> screen is not the way :S but..
[01:00] <NOR> ?
[01:00] <tjone270_> to run it daemonised, you'll need to either suspend and background the process, (and disown if you want to exit the remote shell, if it's remote).
[01:01] <NOR> mm, command example?
[01:01] <tjone270_> You can also start the process with nohup, and end the line with & to daemonise it. 
[01:01] <tjone270_> ./quakestart.sh & disown %1
[01:01] <tjone270_> or 
[01:02] <tjone270_> nohup ./quakestart.sh &
[01:02] <tjone270_> or use supervisor
[01:02] <NOR> should I su as "user" before running ?
[01:03] <tjone270_> indeed
[01:03] <NOR> :)
[01:03] <NOR> Ok, I've seen the bash script for launching multiple servers, but how about starting at server startup
[01:04] <NOR> ?
[01:04] <tjone270_> as in if the linux server itself has been down, and to start the quake process on boot?
[01:04] <vtchill> just run supervisor and have something like upstart start supervisor at boot
[01:05] <vtchill> thats the way i run it
[01:05] <NOR> ues tjone270_
[01:05] <NOR> yes*
[01:05] <vtchill> that way cyclig the box auto runs the qlds servers 
[01:05] <vtchill> and supervisor will auto restart if one qlds instance crashes while the box is still running
[01:05] <NOR> Ok
[01:05] <tjone270_> what vtchill says will work, or you could whack in a small sudo -u "user" /path/to/script & disown %1
[01:06] <tjone270_> to rc.local

[02:09] <snipe> lonewulf: just remember that in tracerotue a single hop reporting random latency isn't a problem unless the following ups also incur the same latency issue
[02:09] <snipe> eg if there is an increse of 50ms on hop 3 then hop4, hop5, hop6 etc all would have an increase of 50ms if the issue is hop 3
[02:10] <snipe> otherwise it is just icmp rate limiting on the router or switch cpu to protect from dos
[02:10] <snipe> ugh cant type, isn't a problem unless the following hops** also incur the same latency issue
[02:12] <snipe> also if it is your ISP they are not likely todo anything for you unless you are paying for a dedicated circuit which has SLA guarantees

[02:41] <carmethene> snipe: a sudden jump in ping implies a technical issue though
[02:42] <carmethene> if there's a legitimate fault in the line, the ISP should help out
[02:42] <carmethene> but yeah that's good advice re timings
[02:50] <lonewulf> snipe: Appreciate the response. I pretty much understand what you're telling me.
[02:51] <lonewulf> I called my ISP and they are claiming, no packet loss, so no problem.. Currently chatting w/VULTR (vps Im using for qlds)
[02:54] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[02:55] <lonewulf> but tracert shows me leaving my Asus router, 2nd line says * Request timed out. The next 5 hops are all my ISP (ping times in the 20s), then it jumps to 130 ping in the Town my ISP is in.. the next 10 hops or so are all 120 - 150 ping until I get to my qlds ip.
[02:56] <lonewulf> ^^ Thats what made me think the issue was w/my ISP. cause it happens so early in the tracert.
[02:57] <lonewulf> basically the qlds I spawned in Chicago, I USED to get 30-39 ping..and all morning/day long pings times at my Chicago have been 120+ ping.

[02:59] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:59] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[03:01] <lonewulf> I think it almost has to be my ISP..simply because all the other qlds server I USED to ping 20-40 are all now well over 100 ping for me.
[03:03] <lonewulf> Unless those servers are using vultr vps as well.. what are the odds tho?

[03:39] * Rick971_ has joined #qldedsrv
[03:40] <snipe> carmethene: it doesnt suggest anything other than RTT increased
[03:42] <snipe> reasons why can be line/fabric between hop2->hop3 saturated, QoS of ICMP only not udp/tcp, control plane of hop3 saturated(doesnt always increase RTT for tcp/udp), rate limiting of ICMP
[03:42] <snipe> many other possibilities
[03:43] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[03:43] <snipe> it not directly linked to being an issue unless it persists to the subsequent hops
[03:44] <snipe> it is not*
[03:45] <snipe> lonewulf: run winmtr if you are on windows else mtr on linux... it will be a continuous trace
[03:46] <snipe> if you see a jump to 130 in the same town and all the following hops are >=130 then that is the issue
[03:46] <snipe> if subquent hops are <=130 then it is not the issue
[03:47] <snipe> sorry i just cannot type today
[03:47] <snipe> the * * * just indicates rules which are blocking icmp
[03:47] <snipe> in your case.
[03:51] <snipe> carmethene: typically the issue is overselling by the ISP, they often will not help you with that (it is how they make more money) and you will only know by speaking maybe 2-3 levels up from initial phone support
[03:52] <carmethene> interesting
[03:52] <carmethene> I guess I just got lucky then
[03:53] <carmethene> snipe: I did not know about mtr, thanks, that's a neat little tool
[03:54] <snipe> typically if you spend 600$+ then you have an in-network/provider latency commitment in which they will work with you
[03:54] <carmethene> I'm not a network guy - did a lot of this for my degree but I've since forgotten it all

[04:04] <lonewulf> :)
[04:05] <lonewulf> so problem is on there (VULTR) end?
[04:05] <snipe> both directions as the return path from the server may go over different routes
[04:05] <lonewulf> If they are having network engineers looking into it.
[04:05] <snipe> past them both in pastebin.com and link me
[04:05] <snipe> paste/
[04:05] <snipe> X out the end IPs if you want

[04:05] <lonewulf> I was just thinking like this guy isnt going to DDOS me is he?
[04:05] <lonewulf> :p

[04:06] <lonewulf> gotcha
[04:06] <snipe> i havent ddosd anyone in 12 yrs :|
[04:06] <lonewulf> :D
[04:07] <lonewulf> snipe: hold on man..the networking engineer just got back w/me.. they say its my ISP and they are known for doing this.
[04:07] <lonewulf> wtf!?!
[04:07] <snipe> what isp?
[04:08] <snipe> he might just be speaking in general
[04:08] <snipe> but curious
[04:11] <carmethene> that's great customer service from your vps provider
[04:11] <carmethene> well above and beyond
[04:12] <lonewulf> snipe: I'll pastebin what he/she just typed too me..please dont attack me. (DDOS)
[04:12] <lonewulf> shit is crazy
[04:12] <lonewulf> its my ISP
[04:12] <lonewulf> like I orginally thought.
[04:13] <lonewulf> I mean shit, ping jumps up at my ISP and stay hight all the way to VULTR.
[04:13] <snipe> justX out your ips :P
[04:13] <lonewulf> kk
[04:13] <snipe> keep other hop ips
[04:14] <snipe> so right it sounds like isp, im curious about the return route too thou
[04:14] <lonewulf> snipe: I dont see any sensitive info here. (besides my vps qlds ip)
[04:15] <snipe> x that out if you want
[04:15] <lonewulf> snipe: sent in pm.
[04:15] <lonewulf> let me know what you think.
[04:15] <lonewulf> my ISP basically pulled a fast one on me.
[04:16] <lonewulf> routing me shitty intentionally.
[04:16] <lonewulf> crazy man.
[04:16] <carmethene> can you change ISP?
[04:16] <lonewulf> sure
[04:17] <lonewulf> Im not happy w/this cable internet anyways. It shitty.

[04:17] <carmethene> bastards

[04:24] <lonewulf> ah
[04:24] <carmethene> what I'm curious about is why it suddenly got worse
[04:24] <lonewulf> right
[04:25] <carmethene> maybe you could work around it with wtfast or such?
[04:25] <lonewulf> I heard wtfast is fake
[04:25] <lonewulf> not real
[04:25] <lonewulf> only ppl getting sponsor money from them tell ppl wtfast will reduce ping times.

[05:23] <lonewulf> snipe: 
[05:23] <lonewulf> MTR running on my ISP IP
[05:23] <lonewulf> is just a one-liner

[06:18] <m1dnight> What protocols does the server use? tcp or udp? (for server and rcon)
[06:18] <m1dnight> I have opened both atm, but its probably only one of both?
[06:22] <tjone270_> UDP for server
[06:22] <tjone270_> TCP for RCON, iirc
[06:24] <tjone270_> most likely tcp for stats also, but unsure.
[06:25] <m1dnight> hmmm,thats something Im unaware of
[06:25] <m1dnight> oh stats runs on the gameport
[06:25] <m1dnight> so that makes sense
[06:25] <tjone270_> :)
[06:25] <m1dnight> so just tcp for rcon then
[06:25] <m1dnight> thanks tjone270_
[06:25] <tjone270_> pretty sure :) welcome
[06:25] <m1dnight> lets see if this thing runs on an atom.. :>
[06:26] <tjone270_> def will
[06:26] <m1dnight> good. Its on a home connection, but a 250/20 mbit connection
[06:26] <m1dnight> so im guessing that wil do just fine.

[17:53] <roasticle> easiest way to monitor a bunch of servers is open a steam server info window for each hah
[17:53] <roasticle> they refresh stats automatically
[17:54] <m1dnight> how do you do that?
[17:54] <roasticle> as far as just looking at maps/player activity
[17:54] * m1dnight is new to all the steam stuff
[17:54] <roasticle> find your server in steam right click show server info
[17:54] <roasticle> you can do that for multiple servers and it opens a window for each
[17:55] <m1dnight> oh like that :D
[17:55] <m1dnight> Eh, quake doesnt run properly here. Cba to fix it.
[17:55] <m1dnight> Im just the serverguy :>
[17:57] <roasticle> these windows will tell you if server is not responding as well

[18:16] <m1dnight> where does one put the qlserver.cfg files?
[18:16] <m1dnight> I see that .quakelive/serverport/baseq3 is in the searchpath
[18:16] <m1dnight> but i think thats the one that gets overwritten, right?
[18:23] <roasticle> if you are setting seperate fs_basepath's they wont get overwritten
[18:23] <m1dnight> ah that would be another flag to the binary then
[18:23] <m1dnight> lemme see
[18:23] <m1dnight> (small note: ^C doesnt work to stop a server? I have to sigkill it?)
[18:33] <Drayan> does for me
[18:33] <m1dnight> odd
[18:33] <Drayan> might be because I set ttycon to 0
[18:33] <m1dnight> oh wait, might be because im running it through a script
[18:34] <m1dnight> but i dont think so, though

[20:25] <m1dnight> Drayan: how do you set the ttycon?
[20:25] <m1dnight> Is it an argument to the binary?
[20:27] <Drayan> +set ttycon 0
[20:27] <Drayan> yes

[20:41] <m1dnight> is there a manpage or something for that binary, btw?
[20:42] <m1dnight> the manual says "you can add commandline options at will" thats nice, but which ones are there :>
[20:42] <vtchill> asked this yesterday, sponge suggesting looking at /listcvars command and also looking at g_, sv_, etc. commands from console
[20:43] <vtchill> no manual
[20:43] <m1dnight> oh
[20:43] <m1dnight> oh basically they are qlserver.cfg commands
[20:43] <m1dnight> that explains a lot
[20:43] <m1dnight> I thought they were specific to the binary
[20:43] <vtchill> yea basically
[20:44] <vtchill> i think it just passes them through to the qlds for parsing
[20:44] <lonewulfn6> logfile 0
[20:45] <lonewulfn6> then command
[20:45] <lonewulfn6> will output to txt file
[20:45] <vtchill> what does the number after logfile mean?
[20:45] <lonewulfn6> not sure
[20:47] * mikul is now known as mikul|afk
[20:53] <m1dnight> hmm ^C still doesnt work
[20:53] <m1dnight> strange
[20:56] <m1dnight> in htop I do can see that the ttycon optoin is not in the flaglist
[20:56] <m1dnight> so perhaps a syntax error
[21:35] <McAfee> number after logfile means, bufferd or unbuffered writes, afaik
[21:36] <McAfee> if you have a crash situation that is not a graceful crash, you dont want buffered writes

[17:45] <Drayan> yes
[17:45] <Drayan> if you want to add you do something.factories
[17:45] <PaasHaas> ah kk
[17:46] <PaasHaas> how to load the file then?
[17:46] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[17:46] <Drayan> it's automatic
[17:46] <PaasHaas> huh
[17:46] <McAfee> automagical :P

[17:46] <PaasHaas> ahhh
[17:46] <PaasHaas> kk
[17:47] <PaasHaas> will try thx :)
[17:47] <PaasHaas> one more question
[17:47] <PaasHaas> added workshops in the workshop file...but it downloads everytime @ serverstart
[17:47] <Drayan> are you launching qzeroded from the same folder each time?
[17:48] <PaasHaas> yea
[17:48] <Drayan> as in, your current working directory
[17:48] <Drayan> not the file location
[17:48] <PaasHaas> ill try
[17:48] <PaasHaas> thx
[17:49] <Drayan> I put a "cd ~/Steam/" in my launch script
[17:49] <Drayan> so workshop items always get saved relative to there
[17:50] <McAfee> hmm, i thought it would use the fshomepath
[17:50] <Drayan> nah
[17:50] <Drayan> maybe it should, I'm not sure what happens when you launch multiple servers at the same time and try to update the same workshop item simultaneously
[17:50] <Drayan> and it tries to update*
[17:51] <PaasHaas> oke...launch scrip starts with exec /home/steam blabla
[17:51] <McAfee> depends if it downloads to temp file and overwrite, or it writes in place
[17:51] <PaasHaas> need to cd first?
[17:51] <Drayan> I put cd before the qzeroded lines
[17:52] <PaasHaas> kk will try

[22:11] <m1dnight> Would DigitalOcean be a good provider for a quakeserver?
[22:11] <m1dnight> Before I buy a droplet
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> many use dig ocean for quake servers
[22:13] <m1dnight> cool. then ill buy one as well.
[22:13] <PerpetualWar> but some experience lags
[22:13] <m1dnight> First im going to try and debug the ping issues with my home server. Not sure why it gives high latency for people outside .be
[22:14] <PerpetualWar> you can also check host1plus
[22:20] <b1ngo> wait
[22:21] <b1ngo> all our pRophecy servers running at gamerzhost.de
[22:21] <b1ngo> check that out also

[19:38] <Hajen> Anyone know how to enable autodownload for a server ?
[19:42] <roasticle> i didnt have to enable anything when i added my workshop maps
[19:43] <tjone270> Auto-download is now irrelevant afaik
[19:43] <Drayan> Hajen: if your server has custom maps you should upload them to the workshop
[19:43] <Drayan> and yes, autodownload is dead
[19:43] <roasticle> ya downloads from workshop, not server
[19:44] <Hajen> ok, so if i have custom workshop maps installed in server the client shall get t he map automatically
[19:44] <Hajen> not a cvar to set in the server ?
[19:44] <Drayan> right
[19:45] <Hajen> It does not seem to work on my server. Any suggestion what might be wrong ?
[19:45] <Drayan> did you use workshop.txt?
[19:45] <Hajen> yes
[19:46] <Hajen> the server can change map, but im emediatly thrown out when not having the map/ra3map9.pl3
[19:47] <Hajen> the server does not seem to enable autodownload for the client for some reason
[19:47] <tjone270> the clients download the items via steam, so do the servers
[19:47] <Drayan> the only reason I can think of that happening is that you manually moved the ra3 map pk3 on your server
[19:47] <Drayan> to baseq3
[19:47] <tjone270> so no file transfer occurs from the server to the client
[19:47] <Drayan> maybe there's a clientside cvar for it
[19:47] <Hajen> exactly
[19:48] <Hajen> i just added the numbers to workshop.txt and the server downloaded the maps automatically when starting
[19:48] <tjone270> are you sure it didn't say "failed download" or similar
[19:48] <Hajen> yes
[19:49] <Hajen> they are present in the correct directories
[19:50] <tjone270> hmm
[19:50] <tjone270> weird then
[19:50] <Hajen> no additional port to open ?
[19:51] <tjone270> nope, as I say, no transfer between server+client regarding workshop maps
[19:51] <Hajen> but if the client is missing the map what happens
[19:51] <tjone270> server references a map to client, if client has map, load map, else request item download from steam, load map upon download completion
[19:51] <Hajen> AHA! then it must be a client issue
[19:51] <Hajen> :)
[19:52] <Hajen> ty
[19:52] <tjone270> not entirely necessarily
[19:52] <tjone270> try running https://github.com/tjone270/Quake-Live/blob/master/qlds-scripts/autodownload.sh
[19:53] <tjone270> I've had a similar issue that you've described
[19:53] <tjone270> that script will remove all workshop maps and re-download them externally from QLDS, which works better for me than QLDS download does
[19:54] <Hajen> ok now its running
[19:54] <tjone270> with my script or something else?
[19:55] <Hajen> yes
[19:55] <tjone270> well, which?
[19:55] <Hajen> after the autodownload completes ill try again and keep you posted
[19:55] <tjone270> oh, I see, thanks
[19:57] <Hajen> Im going to build an irc bot that fetches data from the server and analysis the data. Were are the server logs stored ?
[19:57] <tjone270> if you're running the server in supervisor, check out /tmp/qzeroded_*
[19:58] <tjone270> otherwise, might be in the fs_homepath
[19:58] <Hajen> using supervisor
[20:10] * crobartie has quit IRC (Signed off)
[20:12] <Hajen> Tried it again from client side. But first i removed the workshop folder in the client machine and tried to connect. It downloaded the map but the client culden't load the map
[20:13] <Hajen> I guess the the map is broken !?
[20:13] <Hajen> can this happen ?
[20:13] <tjone270> what map is it again
[20:13] <Hajen> ra3mapXY
[20:13] <QBall> its possible, people are are uploading all kinds of crap to the workshop atm :D
[20:13] <Hajen> XY = 1,2,6,9,...
[20:13] <Hajen> it worked yesterday
[20:13] <Hajen> ....
[20:14] <Hajen> quakelive updated.
[20:14] <tjone270> loaded ra3map13 just now, no problems
[20:14] <Hajen> did you connect from client ?
[20:15] <tjone270> yes

[20:16] <tjone270>  /connect brisbane.quakelive.tomtecsolutions.com.au:27960
[20:16] <Hajen> i got it to work
[20:17] <Hajen> ty for help
[20:17] <tjone270> you're welcome :)
[20:17] <Hajen> i think autodownload.sh solved it
[20:17] <Hajen> i have three servers running
[20:17] <tjone270> ah, good :D
[20:17] <Hajen> on two i updated the maps using your  scripts
[20:17] <Hajen> on the third i did not
[20:17] <Hajen> that one did not work
[20:17] <Hajen> but the others did
[20:17] <tjone270> I see
[20:18] <Hajen> :)
[20:18] <tjone270> that's good :D
[20:18] <Hajen> yes
[20:19] <tjone270> sponge-: if I set a cvar that doesn't exist in a factory, like "helloworld":"1", will it create the cvar, or fail and move on
[20:20] <sponge-> dunno! i think it will fail and move on
[20:20] <tjone270> okay, how does one create cvars?
[20:20] <sponge-> you can't
[20:21] <sponge-> you might be able to add it in server.cfg
[20:21] <sponge-> i dont know i never tried it
[20:21] <tjone270> okay, so like seta helloworld 1?
[20:21] <sponge-> yea
[20:21] <tjone270> I'm reading the listcmds 
[20:22] <tjone270> there's a cvaradd command and cvarmult command
[20:22] <tjone270> what're they for
[20:24] <tjone270> sponge-?
[20:24] <sponge-> cvaradd cg_fov -5
[20:24] <sponge-> reduces fov by 5 everytime you do it
[20:24] <tjone270> ah, I see, math functions

[22:21] <McAfee> ...i tested it, factories can create cvars

[22:42] <Drayan> you change gametype with the map command (or the callvote map command)
[22:42] <Drayan> callvote map ironworks ctf
[22:45] <Temppp> so using this "+set sv_mappoolFile "mappool_pqlffa.txt"" will make the server an ffa server?

[22:46] <Drayan> er
[22:46] <McAfee> assuming the file exists

[22:56] * vtchill has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[22:56] <[ByQ]Descent> +set basegt "ffa" \+set factory "ffa" \+set fraglimit 100 \+set sv_mapPoolFile = "mappool_ffa.txt" \
[22:58] * Oh`Christ is now known as Oh`Christ`Off
[22:58] <sponge-> what on earth
[22:58] <sponge-> just do +map campgrounds ffa
[22:58] <sponge-> those are not console cvars
[22:59] <sponge-> and you dont do = in +set either
[22:59] <sponge-> err sorry +map won't work on the cmdline, there's a cvar serverStartup in server.cfg or something, use that instead so it runs when the servers finishes loading
[22:59] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[23:00] <sponge-> but yea all you need to do to lock a server to a gametype is to add 8 to g_voteflags and use an appropriate mappool, thats it
[23:02] <McAfee> i don't understand the "Not follow the guide" mentality
[23:03] <[ByQ]Descent> .. setting multiple servers may be such unpredictable .. :D

[01:16] <lonewulf> Update: $5 Digital Ocean, $5 Vultr not enough really..
[01:17] <lonewulf> The Hitch warning(s): are real.
[01:17] <Drayan> how many servers?
[01:17] <[ByQ]Descent> what configuration?
[01:17] <lonewulf> 1
[01:17] <Drayan> eh
[01:17] <[ByQ]Descent> 1?
[01:17] <Drayan> x86 or x64?
[01:17] <kanzo> what
[01:17] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[01:18] <lonewulf> happens with one, or 3, or 10 instances..thats not the issue.
[01:18] <Drayan> i've yet to have a hitch
[01:18] <kanzo> bots?
[01:18] <lonewulf> no bots
[01:18] <lonewulf> single cpu is struggling.
[01:18] <lonewulf> tons of ppl have, and are complaining about it.
[01:19] <[ByQ]Descent> maybe its vps, its linux/qldedsrv configuration issues ..
[01:20] <lonewulf> tried both x86 and x64
[01:21] <[ByQ]Descent> lags or what?
[01:22] <lonewulf> Its a Hitch warning.
[01:22] <lonewulf> so yes, lag.
[01:23] <syncore> wat
[01:23] <lonewulf> Going to try 10 dollar USD Vultr, and DO.
[01:23] <syncore> i don't get that on my cheap digitalocean
[01:23] <lonewulf> hrmm
[01:23] <lonewulf> I dont get it all day everday..
[01:24] <lonewulf> but it does seem to happen everyday.
[01:24] <lonewulf> Carry on Soliders. I figure smth out.
[01:25] <lonewulf> s/I/I'll
[01:26] <[ByQ]Descent> I had a  lot of kind of strange problems (lags too - good srv), look at chown/chmod on .quakelive , try to run qlded in terminal under root and check
[01:27] <lonewulf> kk

[01:50] <Hajen_> Do i need to recompile it for x86 ?
[01:51] <Drayan> I think someone said it only worked with x64 but I don't really know
[01:51] <[ByQ]Descent> ... it's only for x64 as far as I know .. x86 in future .. maybe ..
[01:51] <Hajen_> have someone got it to work on x86 ?
[01:52] <Hajen_> I guess its all about the hook.
[01:52] * loveless has joined #qldedsrv
[01:52] <Hajen_> Have anyone tried to compile it ?
[01:53] <[ByQ]Descent> ..
[01:56] <syncore> it is only for x64, and you can talk to the guy who made it in #minqlbot
[01:56] <Hajen_> ok

[22:05] <[ByQ]Descent> :D
[22:11] <[ByQ]Descent> so only germans can fix problem with ql server? :D
[22:12] <[ByQ]Descent> sure that not  .. =)
[22:14] <DS4ever01> hahah xD no i dont think so... but its easy for me to explain in german than in english =D
[22:14] <DS4ever01> i need a sample script for freezetag instagib.. 
[22:15] <DS4ever01> and i cant find my server in the quake live serverlist/overview
[22:24] <[ByQ]Descent> try to connect it using /connect ip
[22:25] <[ByQ]Descent> check if it works ..

[23:37] <carmethene> holy shit, the proverek map
[23:37] <carmethene> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=560610357&searchtext=
[23:38] <carmethene> I've never seen this one before
[23:38] <McAfee> i guess the german figured it out, didnt even say thanks
[23:39] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[23:39] <McAfee> carmethene, it's nice to see original ideas in maps
[23:39] <McAfee> :P
[23:39] <carmethene> McAfee: my experience is that the community hates originality
[23:39] <carmethene> McAfee: have you seen that map?  the screenshot doesn't do it justice
[23:40] <carmethene> it's overkill and campgrounds stuck together
[23:40] <McAfee> i was being sarcastic
[23:40] <carmethene> given that those are basically the only two maps anyone ever callvotes
[23:40] <carmethene> I know you were
[23:40] <carmethene> I'm English, we invented sarcasm
[23:40] <carmethene> :P
[23:40] <McAfee> you need to mix campgrounds and bloodrun = epic
[23:40] <carmethene> interesting idea
[23:41] <sponge-> i had converted/mirrored bloodrun for ctf, it was a surprisingly good map
[23:41] <[ByQ]Descent> btw, is mappack with maps (ex:intelbloodrun) used anywhere?  is any problems with .pk3 downloadin and joinin servers?
[23:41] <carmethene> where did you put the mirror?
[23:41] <McAfee> sponge- weren't you off xD
[23:41] <McAfee> until monday :P
[23:41] <sponge-> no im in the office today im off tomorrow
[23:42] <carmethene> [ByQ]Descent: what do you mean?  bloodrunblue (the intel one) works fine
[23:42] <sponge-> carmethene: uh in that ya/pg room i think, the window where the quad spawns in ffa
[23:42] <carmethene> sponge-: gotcha
[23:42] <carmethene> that makes sense
[23:42] <[ByQ]Descent> ok , thnx :D
[23:43] <McAfee> i haven't seen the space variant of campgrounds in a while, is it still there?
[23:43] <carmethene> [ByQ]Descent: have to get the extra map pack from the workshop, not sure I understood your question
[23:43] <sponge-> its in the holiday pack
[23:43] <carmethene> McAfee: yes
[23:43] <carmethene> oh holiday pack? my bad
[23:43] <[ByQ]Descent> I know, saw the comments with problems, decided to wait until everything went ok .. 
[23:43] <carmethene> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539421606
[23:44] <carmethene> oh I get it
[23:44] <sponge-> https://www.dropbox.com/s/bgwc7eyu121hv36/ztnctf.bsp found it
[23:44] <carmethene> spacecamp is in the holiday pack
[23:44] <carmethene> derp
[23:44] <carmethene> [ByQ]Descent: oh, so there are definitely issues
[23:44] <carmethene> a number of people couldn't join the server (unpure pk3 kick) with those blue maps
[23:45] <carmethene> they all fixed it by nuking their quake install and downloading clean from Steam
[23:45] <[ByQ]Descent> thats it .. so thats why I'm asking ..
[23:45] <sponge-> thats fixed, people had the bloodrunintel.pk3 and zz_qcon_ads.pk3 in their dir
[23:45] <carmethene> sponge-: ah great
[23:45] <[ByQ]Descent> ok
[23:45] <carmethene> there's no way for me to add that ztn map without it being on the workshop right?
[23:46] <carmethene> unless I go non-pure
[23:46] <sponge-> its not really complete/suitable for play
[23:46] <carmethene> oh
[23:46] <sponge-> but you can +set sv_pure 0 and then dump it in your basepath baseq3 to load it up and try it
[23:46] <carmethene> ta
[23:48] <McAfee> in this day and age, can't a game be payed for and still have ads? or that's a no-no ?
[23:49] <sponge-> there aren't really any games that do in-game ads anymore
[23:50] * lonewulf has joined #qldedsrv
[23:50] * vtchill has joined #qldedsrv
[23:51] <McAfee> is the windows dedicated (using a shortcut) a definite failure, or it can run for a few weeks without crashing?
[23:51] <sponge-> but yea workshop wise, i'm not surprised, but still disappointed that it's just been q3 re-uploads all the way pretty much
[23:54] <McAfee> i'd expect most of the custom maps ever on a regular rotation to be ported at some point
[23:55] <McAfee> From a custom content point of view, is there anything quake3 can still do, that quake live would not be able to do? (eg: mods/scripts)
[23:55] * Danmer has quit IRC (Signed off)
[23:57] <[ByQ]Descent> maybe its more about q3 times, not mods/maps: in the early 200x were a lot internet clubs/cafes (in eastern europe for sure) to play q2/q3, clans, clanwars, a lot of local tourneys and etc.. 
[23:58] <McAfee> i mean from the point of view, of replacing what's left of the quake3 community, and not hear excuses
[23:58] <McAfee> it would be more people playing quakelive
[23:58] <McAfee> if everything was eventually ported
[23:59] <[ByQ]Descent> no local communities ... internet games - kind of depressive thing ..
[23:59] <sponge-> ql can't do mods but otherwise should be the same
[23:59] * PerpetualWar is now known as PerpetualWa_off
[23:59] <McAfee> i used to go a lot of lan parties, broadband made them obsolete
Session Time: Thu Nov 26 00:00:00 2015
[00:00] <sponge-> more people are not going to play ql if all the content from q3 was there since there's not really anyone playing q3 in any significant numbers either
[00:00] <McAfee> to go to*
[00:01] <McAfee> but still, is there anything that quake3 can do, that ql can't do?
[00:01] <McAfee> gibs xD
[00:02] <[ByQ]Descent> everything can be made by custom factory (balance)
[00:03] <McAfee> and as far as mods go?
[00:03] <carmethene> 13:00      sponge-@ : ql can't do mods but otherwise should be the same
[00:03] <[ByQ]Descent> t4 @ q3: 100 starting health, rail damage 100, +10 frags .. :D
[00:03] <carmethene> that said, minqlx is getting powerful enough now to be a mod platform
[00:06] <[ByQ]Descent> minqlx have problems with pointing itself, because the way "LD_PRELOAD" looks "not good" in case of "Steam" and "Id Software" licences ...
[00:07] <Drayan> what?
[00:07] <[ByQ]Descent> for sure, ql-managers had to have done kind of api to make such things "legal" ..
[00:08] <[ByQ]Descent> :D
[00:26] <sponge-> nope we didnt do crap for minqlx
[00:32] * trapgod has joined #qldedsrv
[00:40] <rzeka> Guys, what are sv_antic*Threshold for?
[00:40] <[ByQ]Descent> I mean that minqlx has to be ALREADY kind of osp for q3.. problem only with absence ql-c-api that brakes development of minqlx and ql ..
[00:46] <[ByQ]Descent> and another problem is servers monetization (not only ql), donation NOT-SOLUTION-FOR-SURE, my opinion is following: steam-top-managers have to be kicked right now.
[00:51] * g0rilla has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:52] <McAfee> i didnt understand that last sentence
[00:53] <[ByQ]Descent> :D sure you did ..
[00:54] <[ByQ]Descent> servers owners by default have part of subscriptions money ...
[00:55] <McAfee> server owners as in the people who own the farms and rent them, or as in the admin that is renting a server and managing it?
[01:00] <[ByQ]Descent> as people who making servers, which are part of business with money flows ..
[01:12] <carmethene> I have a problem...
[01:12] <carmethene> ra3map19 got updated like an hour ago
[01:12] <carmethene> someone called it
[01:12] <carmethene> so now anyone who connects, can't connect
[01:13] <carmethene> since steam is giving them a different version of the map to the server
[01:13] <carmethene> is there anything I can do about this situation?

[01:13] <[ByQ]Descent> [23:45] <sponge-> thats fixed, people had the bloodrunintel.pk3 and zz_qcon_ads.pk3 in their dir
[01:13] <[ByQ]Descent> [23:45] <carmethene> sponge-: ah great
[01:13] <[ByQ]Descent> [23:45] <[ByQ]Descent> ok
[01:13] <carmethene> I mean, I know I can delete the workshop maps and restart, but I have no way of knowing WHEN that is necessary and it's a lot to redownload
[01:13] <carmethene> just restarting the server doesn't seem to make it redownload the offending map either
[01:15] <[ByQ]Descent> ..thats why I do not use custom maps until this get resolved ..
[01:15] <McAfee> have a launch script that check for update, relaunch server once a week regardless
[01:16] <carmethene> I've written a script that kills my supervisor processes, deletes the maps, starts a single server, downloads them, kills that server and restarts supervisord
[01:16] <carmethene> so it's easy to sort, other than the time it takes
[01:16] <carmethene> it's just the complete lack of control over when it's necessary that's causing me issues
[01:16] <carmethene> like, he changed a map at lunchtime today, so what can I do?
[01:16] <McAfee> must the server be actually killed?
[01:16] <McAfee> cant a map change do the trick?
[01:16] <sponge-> you need to restart the server to check for workshop updates
[01:16] <carmethene> what sponge said
[01:16] <[ByQ]Descent> maybe it is on the client side?
[01:16] * b1ngo is now known as b1ngo|offline
[01:17] <carmethene> sponge-: restarting the server doesn't seem to actually download updates
[01:18] <carmethene> just confirmed it, killed the server, restarted, still on old version of the workshop map
[01:18] <carmethene> so, I guess I could nuke the workshop folder and start a different server process on some hidden port to repopulate the cache without killing the original server
[01:18] <carmethene> that's hacky and error prone though
[01:19] <McAfee> and then compare the files and restart the servers if not identical
[01:19] <McAfee> tedious
[01:20] <McAfee> i havent played with workshop stuff, at all
[01:43] <sponge-> i'm not sure, i've definitely had updates download before
[01:48] <McAfee> workshop.txt uses same comment type as access.txt ?

[03:44] <carmethene> I don't know how fixable it is at this point and how much you guys care, but this is probably the biggest show-stopper in qlds from my POV :/
[03:44] <carmethene> wish workshop was smart enough to issue specific content versions
[03:45] * carmethene is currently running the clean/restart script for the third time today after discovering that the server was in the broken state yet again
[03:45] <carmethene> > 1gb downloads every time I do this
[03:47] <McAfee> carmethene did you try with the steamcmd thingy too?
[03:48] <McAfee> i was looking at the differnt files, and it seems to have enough info there to do some version control
[03:50] <carmethene> McAfee: is there a steamcmd for updating workshop content?
[03:50] <carmethene> I haven't used it beyond downloading the qlds binaries
[03:50] <carmethene> hmm
[03:50] <carmethene> innnnnnnnnnteresting
[03:51] <carmethene> McAfee: you might be onto somethign here, thanks!
[03:51] <carmethene> my server is up to date now, but I will try that next time
[03:52] <McAfee> there's a sample command in the guide
[03:53] <McAfee> i tried to dmg the files by doing echo "giblets" > file.bleh
[03:53] <McAfee> but it doesn't do any repairing
[03:53] <McAfee> that's when i looked at all the control files
[03:53] <McAfee> maybe there is a way to fool it into forcing a download
[03:54] <McAfee> by making the version controls in those files, old

[04:34] <EduCatOR> whats the ideal FPS to set a server at?
[04:34] <EduCatOR> just leave it at 40 fps?
[04:35] <syncore> i think so
[04:35] <vks> yes, 40 is good
[04:35] <syncore> i think anything else is untested and might have weird side-effects
[04:38] <EduCatOR> how do you make someone a 'ref' of a server?
[04:39] <EduCatOR> memchunks is amount of member dedicated to the server?
[04:39] <vks> com_hunkmegs is ram server is allowed to use
[04:40] <EduCatOR> 60mb seems to do the trick, could prob host a lot of servers on one vps lol
[04:40] <EduCatOR> maybe raise a bit for better experience
[04:40] <EduCatOR> 12 person server
[04:40] <vks> for a server with 32 players on it to run smooth, i have found com_hunkmegs should be set to 700 min
[04:41] <McAfee> personally i've lowered it, my vps will not have a lot of memory
[04:41] <McAfee> anyone have proof the hunkmegs actually yields performance, and not just a crash / not-crash behavior
[04:41] <EduCatOR> lol
[04:41] <EduCatOR> i wish they had a motd :-/
[04:42] <vks> well, crash is = bad performance no?
[04:42] <McAfee> if anything, you are taking ram from the os, that WILL do catching
[04:42] <McAfee> ok but lets say 60 was in fact good enough, thats 640 you are taking from the os, and the os will do caching, where as the game, we dont know
[04:42] <vks> mcafee: thats why my vps is 6 gigs of ram
[04:43] <McAfee> still, 6,640 > 6000 :P
[04:43] <vks> mcafee: not so
[04:43] <McAfee> which part is "not so"?
[04:43] <EduCatOR> tehg ame does not swap as needed?
[04:43] <vks> the process will begin at minimum needed to run, then as required, will increase in ram usage
[04:44] <vks> untill it hits the com_hunkmegs settings
[04:44] <McAfee> allocated my go up, but the rest would be reserved?
[04:44] <McAfee> may*
[04:44] <vks> not reserved
[04:44] <EduCatOR> but available
[04:44] <EduCatOR> if unused?
[04:45] <vks> you can crash the server if say its a 1 gig vps, and you set comhunkmegs to 1024, then as pll connect
[04:45] <vks> ram usage increases, until crash
[04:45] <vks> eg, you take all the ram and none left for os to run
[04:45] <EduCatOR> i was thinking more like 120mb intead of 60
[04:45] <EduCatOR> for a 12 person server
[04:45] <EduCatOR> gigabit connection
[04:46] <EduCatOR> thats why i was wondering if sv_fps is like ticrate for cs servers
[04:46] <vks> sv_fps is same as sv_maxsnaps was in q3
[04:47] <vks> i believe
[04:47] <McAfee> uhm
[04:47] <McAfee> top's virt 32mb vs 1024mb hunkmegs: 413,008   vs 1,363,280

[04:51] <vks> expand your channel window
[04:53] <McAfee> the virt is still higher when hunkmegs is higher
[04:55] <vks> mcafee: i have not done any comparisons
[04:56] <vks> that is running on a vps with 6gigs of ram
[04:56] <McAfee> idk what the os will do with virt when memory runs low
[04:57] <vks> i imagine as long as there is enough ram available, os will run fine
[04:57] <vks> i believe my server, with just os running uses 400megs of ram
[04:57] <vks> thats debian 8.1
[04:59] <vks> ubuntu uses more ram i know
[05:00] <McAfee> some vps don't have a lot of memory, so the information may still be important, just because "your" vps has memory to spare, doesn't mean it's not important. Also some people may want to run MANY servers, or have other software running in that memory
[05:00] <vks> i understand.
[05:00] <vks> i only providing my experiance information
[05:01] <McAfee> now, i have seen no evidence the game performs better with 60 vs higher settings (other than avoiding a low memory crash) and i'm not sure how the OS handles virt, if it lets other processes use it anyway, and if it allows caching over said number.
[05:02] <vks> it has been my experiance, on my own server, with comhunkmegs set to 512 as follows
[05:03] <vks> server ran smooth with 20 players
[05:03] <vks> with 24 players, lag increased noticable
[05:03] <vks> with 26 players, dmg counters stopped working
[05:03] <vks> with 30 players anomilies began, like players would stop mid air
[05:04] <vks> with 31 players, game crashed
[05:04] <vks> server did not
[05:05] <vks> not sure if that is an apropriate answer to your performance question
[05:06] <McAfee> and how many players have you ran with 700 hunkmegs?
[05:06] <vks> after 512 incident, i increased to 768 hunkmegs
[05:07] <vks> lag increased noticably at 26 players
[05:08] <vks> with 32 players, lag was worse, but still playable, only in high actions areas did lag become an issue
[05:08] <McAfee> well, there is a direct relationship between player count and hunkmegs, i just dont know if the other "glitches" are attributed to hunkmegs too, or other performance problems of the engine
[05:08] <McAfee> hunkmegs 60 will never support 32 players
[05:08] <McAfee> it will just run out and crash
[05:09] <vks> i now run 1024 hunkmegs, still get lag in certain senarios and on certain maps, but it is limited, this with 32 players
[05:09] <vks> i have tried 1540 comhunkmegs, did not improve the limited lag i menntion above
[05:10] <McAfee> what im trying to get at is, admin X has a perfectly running server, he hears about hunkmegs, and decides to increase it to 1024... Would it perform any better, if there were originally no problems?
[05:10] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[05:10] <McAfee> the engine could have not been thoroughly tested with those player counts
[05:10] <McAfee> the variable goes up to 64, i'm not sure if it actually would work in practice
[05:10] <vks> if player count increases from when no problem, then i believe yes, also depends on vps ram amount
[05:11] <vks> you dont want to starve the os
[05:11] <vks> or and other processes for example redis-server
[05:11] <vks> if your running a bot
[05:11] <[ByQ]Descent> mm,  ql inside has its limits like every program  ..
[05:11] <McAfee> quake is also a single threaded app, if i recall
[05:12] <McAfee> processors have gotten better at multithreaded, but single threads havent changed much
[05:12] <vks> yes, but the server and other processes are not
[05:12] <vks> most if not all are multithreaded
[05:12] <vks> and at the end of the day, the server itself is multi threaded, 
[05:13] <McAfee> maybe the server would need more single-threaded performance to be able to run the quake process with up to 64 players
[05:13] <vks> so just because qzerod is single threaded, ....
[05:14] <vks> agreed mcafee
[05:14] <vks> =cpu speed and cpu cache
[05:15] <McAfee> i have no evidence that high virt would affect the OS in a negative way, but cant prove the opposite either
[05:15] <[ByQ]Descent> :D
[05:15] <vks> unfortunately, any use of swap, will negatively impact os performance
[05:15] <vks> along with everything else
[05:17] <McAfee> it seems it definitly needs to exist:
[05:17] <McAfee> my system has 2gb of ram no swap --> Sys_Error: Hunk data failed to allocate 1600 megs
[05:17] <McAfee> thats what happens if i go to high
[05:17] <McAfee> too high
[05:18] <vks> 2gb of ram is sufficient to eliminate swap
[05:18] <vks> sorr, not sufficient
[05:18] <McAfee> i only have quakelive running on that linux
[05:18] <EduCatOR> i only have one little server running as well on mine
[05:19] <McAfee> and in fact i dont want more because the vps i want to rend is cheap, but low memory, only 512mb
[05:19] <McAfee> rent*
[05:19] <vks> mcafee, to elimnate swap, you must change many variables in the os to not look for it
[05:20] <vks> like .tmp, .sysctl, etc by default write to swap
[05:21] <McAfee> they write to a tmpfs filesystem
[05:21] <McAfee> tmpfs handles that
[05:21] <vks> =swap
[05:22] <McAfee> tmpfs            1006324       4   1006320   1% /tmp
[05:22] <vks> i enjoy our convos mcafee
[05:22] <vks> =]
[05:22] <McAfee> but i didnt even change anything, this is the default, it's ubuntu on a usb key with persitant storagee
[05:22] <EduCatOR> does the server.cfg refresh with every map or do i need to restart the server?
[05:22] <McAfee> EduCatOR, you could exec it
[05:23] <McAfee> but it wont be read again by default
[05:23] <McAfee> vks, i needed a linux machine to test with before moving to a VPS, im using a usbkey to takeover other computers in my house temporarily
[05:24] <McAfee> it was a high performance 3.0 usb key when i bought it, it still has some kick in it
[05:24] <McAfee> so yeah, it doesn't run swap by default
[05:25] <vks> well, when you installed ubuntu, did you do the easy install?
[05:25] <vks> or advanced
[05:26] <vks> how many partitions on usb
[05:26] <vks> advanced install will get you 4 partitions
[05:26] <EduCatOR> mcafee why not just go to lowendtalk and get real cheap vps?
[05:26] <EduCatOR> vps i use for QL is $3.88/month lol
[05:26] <vks> you get /system /home /swap /grub
[05:27] <McAfee> cause i wanted to test quakelive locally, before paying anyone :)
[05:27] <McAfee> the one im planning to get is $25 a year
[05:27] <vks> host?
[05:27] <vks> i have tried many host
[05:27] <vks> s
[05:27] <McAfee> budgetvm, i need a vps in miami area
[05:27] <EduCatOR> heh i feel you, i was going to do the same thing
[05:27] <vks> and found the best for me
[05:28] <vks> i have tried digitalocean.com
[05:28] <vks> vpsdime.com
[05:28] <McAfee> vks, i didnt install ubuntu, this is the livecd environment placed on a usb and added persitant storage
[05:28] <vks> dreamhost.com
[05:28] <vks> bluehost.com
[05:28] <McAfee> when you use a tool like pendrivelinux, persistant storage is just a click away
[05:29] <vks> and for me, and on the west coast. linode.com is the best
[05:29] <vks> by far
[05:29] <EduCatOR> i stick with chicago :)

[05:35] <EduCatOR> are you guys able to get custom maps to show up in the voting area?
[05:35] <vks> number 1 thing to look at for vps and ql server is bandwidth, throttling, and how many vps per actualy hardware machine they run
[05:35] <EduCatOR> steam workshop is a dream come true for Ql
[05:35] <vks> end up on a busy actual server at vps, ql will suck
[05:35] <EduCatOR> lol anything under 20 and you know its not that great lmao 
[05:36] <vks> ^^
[05:36] <EduCatOR> web server i actually host websites on is $80/month
[05:36] <McAfee> vks, it doesn't seem VIRT competes with buffers/cache, it seems the OS only uses it when launching new processes
[05:38] <vks> and when real ram is low
[05:39] <vks> apt-get htop
[05:40] <McAfee> i cant seem to use more than 1380 hunkmegs (in 10 intervals)
[05:40] <EduCatOR> in vps i also look for the actual hardware itself, xeon vs atom 
[05:40] <McAfee> 1390 and above failed
[05:41] <vks> try 1 instance with 1390
[05:41] <vks> i bet you that 2 will fail
[05:41] <vks> afk for 15 min
[05:42] <McAfee> well i tried one with 1380, and then all my other 4 servers with my normal setting, and they are all running
[05:47] <McAfee> also seems the total of different procsess virt, can go over the system's total memory
[05:48] <McAfee> but maybe it would actively restrict a single process from doing so
[05:48] <McAfee> seems to this VIRT reasing is rather useless
[05:48] <McAfee> to me this*
[05:48] <EduCatOR> mcafee have you test sv_fps at all?
[05:48] <McAfee> seems to me this VIRT reading is rather useless*
[05:49] <McAfee> EduCatOR, other people have, they say the server becomes unstable after a while
[05:49] <EduCatOR> i see
[05:50] <McAfee> sponge-, admin X has a perfectly running server, he hears about hunkmegs, and decides to increase it to 1024... Would it perform any better, if there were originally no problems?
[05:50] <sponge-> no you'd just have 900mb of empty and allocated memory
[05:50] <EduCatOR> ^^
[05:51] <McAfee> and the 2nd question to that is, does allocated memory affect the game or os negativly in any way?
[05:51] <EduCatOR> any need to raise it from 60 for 12 person server?
[05:51] <McAfee> in my testing, and using top for info, VIRT doesn't seem to compete with buffers/cache (at least on ubuntu it doesnt)
[05:53] <McAfee> EduCatOR, afaik, 60 will get you very far if it ever crashes with a lack of hunkmegs error, then you need to go higher
[05:53] <vks> sponge: so there is a setting at which com_hunkmegs becomes waste?
[05:54] <sponge-> the default is overkill by about 40mb on like every map except overgrowth and overkill
[05:54] <sponge-> for 16 players
[05:55] <vks> the default being 60?
[05:55] <sponge-> yea
[05:55] <vks> is there a known number each player "costs" the server in ram
[05:55] <sponge-> not really, we never really ran more than 16
[05:56] <vks> sponge, did you happen to read my experiance with 32 above and hunk at 512
[05:56] <sponge-> but its a function of sv_maxclients, not connected clients. so if it doesn't crash immediately it probably won't crash when actually full
[05:56] <sponge-> probably not, i don't really remember
[05:57] <vks>  <vks> it has been my experiance, on my own server, with comhunkmegs set to 512 as follows
[05:57] <vks> [18:03] <vks> server ran smooth with 20 players
[05:57] <vks> [18:03] <vks> with 24 players, lag increased noticable
[05:57] <vks> [18:03] <vks> with 26 players, dmg counters stopped working
[05:57] <vks> [18:03] <vks> with 30 players anomilies began, like players would stop mid air
[05:57] <vks> [18:04] <vks> with 31 players, game crashed
[05:57] <vks> [18:04] <vks> server did not
[05:57] <sponge-> yea scoreboard messages get too big at around 20
[05:57] <sponge-> we've ran 40 players though at quakecon lans
[05:57] <sponge-> so that's not behavior i've ever ran into
[05:57] <McAfee> hmm
[05:57] <vks> no vps to deal with either correct?
[05:58] <vks> running on local server?
[05:58] <McAfee> how would MTU's affect the game at such levels?
[05:58] <vks> MTU you should not change
[05:58] <vks> that is a function of internal networking
[05:58] <vks> 1500 MTU is default
[05:58] <McAfee> right but imagine a heartbeat getting too big, that 1500 is not enough
[05:59] <McAfee> snapshots*
[05:59] <McAfee> suddenly you have a snapshot taking more than 1 packet
[05:59] <vks> MTU is set also at switch, router, firewall levels
[05:59] <McAfee> right (like over the internet)
[05:59] <McAfee> on a LAN you can get away with jumbo packets
[05:59] <sponge-> the game will pack as many messages into a single packet on its own
[05:59] <vks> so anything greater than 1500, must also be set at the other transports, or packet drop
[06:00] <vks> or packet frag
[06:00] <McAfee> sponge-, and the messages that dont fit? discarded or sent in the next?
[06:00] <vks> fragmented that is
[06:00] <vks> packet fragmentation
[06:00] <sponge-> sent in the next
[06:01] <McAfee> so you'd get to a point where a sever goes from 1 UDP per snapshot, to more than 1 per snapshot? (Speaking really large player counts)
[06:02] <sponge-> i dont remember the specifics besides that it does the right thing basically
[06:02] <sponge-> 64 player servers dont really work in ql though because we use way more servercommands than q3 did
[06:02] <sponge-> but they dont break because of udp packet mtu
[06:03] <McAfee> right, i'm just thinking of the consequences of doubled or tripled the packet count per snapshot, over the internet
[06:03] <sponge-> nothing, probably, given how low bw we are compared to modern games, esp of the client authoritative variety
[06:03] <McAfee> ok

[06:37] <[ByQ]Descent> anyone? :D
[06:38] <[ByQ]Descent> blank tdm
[06:38] <[ByQ]Descent> starting weapons + choose one (respawn to redeploy), how to disable?
[06:39] <[ByQ]Descent> loadouts?
[07:00] <McAfee> you want to disable a specific weapon this available as one of the 6 loadout choices?
[07:02] <McAfee> i think you have to set a variable, something like: disable_weapon_bfg 1
[07:10] * EduCatOR has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[07:35] <[ByQ]Descent> looks like g_loadout 0
[07:42] <[ByQ]Descent> not helped
[07:42] <[ByQ]Descent> de-3.ql.ebase.in:27968
[08:00] <McAfee> i dont understand the question :)
[08:01] <[ByQ]Descent> yes it is, g_loadout in default tdm factory
[08:01] <[ByQ]Descent> when you join default tdm server, g_loadout "1" 
[08:01] <McAfee> on a side note, to whom it may concern, 12 player server, tested overgrowth/overkill/overlord, seems 32 hunks is enough, for those wanting to go as low as possible.
[08:02] <McAfee> you want all loadouts off?
[08:02] <[ByQ]Descent> it means, asking to choose primary weapong , gautlet,mg + something
[08:02] <[ByQ]Descent> ok, what do you mean by loadouts btw?
[08:08] <[ByQ]Descent> thnx
[08:08] <McAfee> the choice to pick 1 of 6 extra weapon, that is loadout
[08:09] <[ByQ]Descent> :D 
[08:09] <[ByQ]Descent> kicked.
[08:09] <[ByQ]Descent> :D

[21:05] <[ByQ]Descent> hi
[21:05] <[ByQ]Descent> shutting down idle dedicated server after sv_idleExit (120) secondsversion: 1064 linux-x64 Oct 30 2015 17:10:27
[21:06] <[ByQ]Descent> whats the trick? seems like restart ..
[21:06] <[ByQ]Descent> error.log
[21:17] <kanzo> your server was idle for 120 seconds so it shutdown, idle meaning no map.
[21:24] * Dbzruler72 has joined #qldedsrv
[21:24] <[ByQ]Descent> what does it means "no map" ..
[21:24] <[ByQ]Descent> it cant be - no map
[21:25] <kanzo> what do you see in console
[21:26] <[ByQ]Descent> its  supervisored.. and i have suspicions that is was restared ..
[21:27] <kanzo> check logs
[21:27] <[ByQ]Descent> may it be in case of voting map from extra pack not on server ?
[21:27] <kanzo> no, don't think so, if you vote a map which the server doesn't have nothing happens
[21:27] <kanzo> unless something did happen?
[21:28] <[ByQ]Descent> nothing logged ..
[21:28] <[ByQ]Descent> so it's not exactly that it was restarted .. maybe ..
[21:29] <kanzo> / Exit the server if idle (not running a map) for a specified time. This will allow it to automatically restart
[21:29] <kanzo> / in the case of a game error or other problem. A value of "1" is recommended, but not default, when you are running
[21:29] <kanzo> / the server detached from the terminal.
[21:29] <kanzo> description for sv_idleExit
[21:30] <kanzo> could try fg from supervisorctf
[21:30] <kanzo> to check the console
[21:30] <kanzo> supervisorctl*
[21:32] <[ByQ]Descent> there is not full log ..
[21:33] <[ByQ]Descent>  the same as supervisorctr tail procces_name
[21:34] <[ByQ]Descent> or maybe param needed?
[21:35] <[ByQ]Descent> to see full log ..
[21:37] * Dbzruler72 has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
[21:46] <[ByQ]Descent> fg -10000 process_name not helped
[21:48] <[ByQ]Descent> can proccess  be restarted but in supervisor-status shows old uptime?

[23:48] <carmethene> and only switch if someone callvotes a change
[23:48] <carmethene> do I just empty the map pool?
[23:49] <carmethene> I see the 'end-game voting' flag, perhaps that's what I need?
[23:52] <Linkyyy> carmethene, yes
[23:52] <Linkyyy> change voteflags
[23:58] <carmethene> I tried that
[23:58] <carmethene> it just went to the next map without giving the vote

[19:25] <fragtion> sorry if this is a very common question, but is there still no way to allow a for a server's factory type to be voted for, without causing the server to randomize selection between those factories on every map change ?
[19:28] * mattiZed has joined #qldedsrv
[19:28] * Q sets mode: +v mattiZed
[19:30] <fragtion> just makes no sense that you have to lock a server down to one gametype in order to avoid the problem
[19:35] <fragtion> ah, good ol logs
[19:35] <fragtion> [09:17] <carmethene> anyway, blanking the map pool seemed to do the trick
[19:35] <fragtion> seems to be a common problem ;o
[19:45] <fragtion> ^confirmed that it works
[19:47] <fragtion> still would be nice to have a cvar like sv_mapChangeAction 0=do nothing (stay on same map+factory at end of match), 1=randomize map(factory doesnt change without votemap), 2=randomize factory, 3 (2+1) = randomize map+factory
[19:48] <fragtion> 2 could do what 3 does if randomizing only the gametype is pointless

[20:38] <rzeka> gloat question is, how to archive that?
[20:39] <rzeka> I mean, spawn on FIGHT, not no countdown
[20:39] <gloat> yea i'm not sure, maybe create a custom factorie
[20:39] <gloat> factory*
[20:40] <rzeka> I have custom factory. I just don't know gow to force respawn later
[20:40] <rzeka> :)
[20:47] <vtchill> anyone using the house of quake factory from the steam workshop
[20:48] <vtchill> everytime i try to use it in a map pool file witih (hoq_tdm, hoq_ctf, hoq_ca) i get an error of invalid factory when the server tries to start
[20:48] <vtchill> but the qcon factory worked just fine when i used (qcon_tdm, qcon_ctf, etc.)
[20:48] <vtchill> so i’m not sure what the problem is
[20:49] * Danmer has joined #qldedsrv
[20:50] <PerpetualWar> vtchill
[20:50] <PerpetualWar> try copy factory in baseq3/scripts/ folder
[20:50] <PerpetualWar> and see if it works
[20:51] <vtchill> so copy it from the steamcmd location into my actual fs_homepath baseq3 scripts area/
[20:51] <vtchill> ?
[21:00] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:00] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[21:02] <PerpetualWar> ye
[21:02] <PerpetualWar> or in basepath
[21:02] <PerpetualWar> both will work
[21:03] <PerpetualWar> if that proves to work then I guess its not factory itself
[21:03] <PerpetualWar> thats broken
[21:03] <PerpetualWar> something with workshop
[21:03] <PerpetualWar> rather
[21:04] <PerpetualWar> try to redownload workshop item again and put in proper place
[21:04] <PerpetualWar> should help
[21:06] <vtchill> ok will try it a bit later, don’t have access to server at the moment
[21:06] <vtchill> weird part was the factory looked like it was downloaded properly and was stored in the same path setup as the qcon factory.. and the factory was in the load path when the server started

[01:17] <sponge-> are admins still having the problem of not being able to keep a server running the same map?
[01:17] <sponge-> because it looks like all you have to do is load an empty map list
[01:19] * vtchill has joined #qldedsrv
[01:19] <sponge-> turn off 3 map voting, have an empty maplist, and you'll get a map_restart at the end of the map

[01:38] <McAfee> empty map list, or have the variable empty?
[01:39] <sponge-> i'm not sure what empty variable would do
[01:39] <sponge-> but definitely empty map list
[01:39] <sponge-> it's worth trying either
[01:39] <sponge-> either way, the logic is setup to map_restart 0 if it didn't load any maps in the map pool. i've seen this request a lot so i dont know if that info just isn't out there or not
[01:39] <McAfee> i assume mappool reverts to old functionality if the variable is empty, but never got to test it
[01:40] <sponge-> next version will have a cvar to put the current map as the first choice in the 3 map vote slot too
[01:40] <McAfee> do we need a "server admins" discussion on steam? and have stickies?
[01:40] <McAfee> "next version"? that sounds promising :D
[01:41] <McAfee> i guess i can test the mappool behavior on the client side
[01:44] <McAfee> callvote nextmap will say: no nextmap currently set let me do a 1 frag round
[01:46] <McAfee> 3 map votes shows "voting has ended" immediatly, seems to do a map_restart
[01:47] <McAfee> so that could be useful if someone want to disable the mappool on the fly, without writting any new files

[01:53] <McAfee> I don't think the information is hard to deduce at all, some admins just want other people to do all the thinking for them :/
[01:54] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[02:06] <McAfee> weird, it's not finding my mappool file when doing a listen server, doesnt it search on the \steamid\baseq3 folder? or in this case must use the original baseq3 ?
[02:09] <McAfee> hmmm, it loads it originally, but just doing a reload_mappool command breaks it, without changing neither the location of the file nor the sv_mappoolfile cvar
[02:13] * Rick971_ has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:13] * Rick971_ has joined #qldedsrv
[02:14] <McAfee> dont know whats up with that, but anyway, tested a single map, mappool file, it's smart enough to do a map restart when doing the endgame votes, but doing a callvote nextmap will do a full load.
[02:16] * sothis is now known as SOTHIS
[02:18] <[ByQ]Descent> 2 sponge-: next version? whhennn? =)
[02:18] <McAfee> btw looks like reload_mappool is stopping the listen server from loading mappool files in the homepath
[02:19] <McAfee> must close the entire game  to recover
[02:22] <McAfee> to reproduce, have a listen server with a custom mappool working, and then just happen to do a reload_mappool cmd, it will load the next map, and then finally empty the rotation as if it failed.

[16:32] <bertox> getting Sys_Error: net_strict enabled: couldn't allocate <wan ip> : 27960
[16:33] <bertox> however setting net_ip to <wan ip>:27960 does not produce this error. still not able to connect however
[16:33] <tjone270> you've got something else running on that port
[16:33] <tjone270> either reboot
[16:33] <tjone270> or kill the qzeroded.x** process
[16:33] <bertox> yeah i'm running QL on the windows OS, and the server on VM ubuntu server
[16:34] <tjone270> I see, which hypervisor are you using
[16:35] <KillGradient> good morning.  is anybody available to field some questions, or should i wait for bertox to finish?
[16:36] <bertox> not sure which hypervisor it is set to out the box. using VirtualBox to run it
[16:37] <bertox> should be type-1
[16:37] <KillGradient> VirtualBox is a type 2 hypervisor
[16:37] <bertox> yeah just saw that from a google search
[16:40] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:40] <bertox> no qzeroded process running on either machine as far as I can tell
[16:40] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[16:42] <bertox> rebooted, error persists
[16:43] <bertox> noticed "ERROR: UDP_OpenSocket: bind: Cannot assign requested address"
[16:43] <KillGradient> Your error means that port 27960 cannot be bound to the ip you've assigned
[16:43] <KillGradient> lol
[16:43] <KillGradient> i'm in the same boat :/
[16:43] <bertox> yeah those ports should be opened, i forwarded them last night
[16:43] <bertox> nice, kill two birds with one stone hopefully
[16:44] <KillGradient> i think that ip/port binding is related to the local machine
[16:44] <KillGradient> from that ip, once the right one is input, you can open ports accordingly on your router
[16:45] <KillGradient> I just got a reply from yakumo stating that my current assigned ip (192.168.1.233) is a LAN ip, an that I need an internet ip
[16:45] <KillGradient> whatever that means...
[16:45] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:45] <bertox> you need your WAN ip
[16:45] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[16:45] <bertox> are you running it off a linux machine?
[16:45] <KillGradient> as in my gateway?
[16:45] <KillGradient> yes linux
[16:45] <bertox> try curl -s http://whatismyip.akamai.com/
[16:46] <KillGradient> thank you.  yes that confirms my gateway
[16:46] <KillGradient> well then, i get teh exact same error as you do
[16:46] <bertox> read a response here that might be useful, recommends setting it from the server.cfg
[16:46] <bertox> http://www.quake3world.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2256
[16:46] <bertox> that's q3, but the same code most likely
[16:48] <KillGradient> ok, but you've already tried this, correct?  and problem persists
[16:48] <bertox> no, trying it now though
[16:48] <KillGradient> hahaa
[16:49] <KillGradient> let me know when you've ran across something.  i'm searching as well
[16:49] <KillGradient> jw you wouldn't happen to be running a pfsense router?
[16:52] <KillGradient> so far i'm seeing that the udp binding error occurs because something is already running on that port. 
[16:52] <bertox> i see. no i'm not running that router afaik, it's whatever comcast is barfing up with their modems nowadays
[16:52] <KillGradient> it seems most people with this problem are running the server from their root user.  
[16:53] <bertox> i'm not running from root, but from sudo group user
[16:53] <KillGradient> perhaps if we create a steam user, as the tutorial suggests http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=542966946 , the problem won't happen.
[16:53] <noobieone[solo]> Hello
[16:54] <bertox> ah yes, i did create a new steam user for that part
[16:54] <KillGradient> running from root is the only thing i've done differently.  followed the tutorial to a T
[16:54] <KillGradient> ah man was hoping it would be that ez
[16:54] <noobieone[solo]> does anyone have a server.cfg voor CA?
[16:54] <KillGradient> ok well maybe it's that root cannot be logged in while steam user is running?
[16:55] <noobieone[solo]> i had the same problem with steam use
[16:55] <noobieone[solo]> r
[16:55] <bertox> hmm not sure, i'm to try checking netstat for that port
[16:55] <KillGradient> you, too?
[16:55] <noobieone[solo]> yes
[16:55] <noobieone[solo]> i have installed everything under root
[16:55] <KillGradient> yep yep i did that, too.  
[16:55] <KillGradient> netstat -an | grep "LISTEN" 
[16:56] <KillGradient> and 27960 isn't even listed
[16:56] <KillGradient> this shouldn't be so hard
[16:56] <bertox> hah. and this is why im a front end dev :)
[16:56] <bertox> server voodoo
[16:56] <KillGradient> well if you can't understand then what chance have i got lol?
[16:57] <KillGradient> wish vks was chatting...see him logged on
[16:57] <bertox> still hacking away, no success with the change to server.cfg
[16:57] <KillGradient> i'm gonna have a cig and a think real quick
[16:58] <KillGradient> one thought real quick
[16:58] <noobieone[solo]> does anyone have a example of a server.cfg for ca?
[16:58] <KillGradient> isn't your configuration, as in vm, compounding your problems
[16:58] <noobieone[solo]> i am not sure what i am doing wrong
[16:58] <KillGradient> is windows screwing things up perhaps?
[16:58] <KillGradient> perhaps turn firewall off on windows
[16:59] <bertox> yeah you read my mind
[16:59] <bertox> just did that
[17:00] <bertox> i'll try just changing the port
[17:01] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:01] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[17:02] <bertox> according to the server.cfg comments, if you set net_strict 0, it will attempt to hit open ports starting at 27960+
[17:03] <KillGradient> yeah but how will you know if your port has bound successfully to your ip?
[17:03] <KillGradient> other than reading the log?
[17:03] <bertox> shouldn't give an error :)
[17:03] <bertox> looks like it stops are 27969
[17:03] <bertox> at*
[17:04] <KillGradient> lemme try real quick
[17:04] <KillGradient> all you've done is change net_strict to 0 right?
[17:05] <bertox> yeah
[17:06] <KillGradient> just ran it and got bind: cannot assign requested address for ports 27960 - 27969
[17:06] <KillGradient> i've set my ip to my gateway, as you prescribed
[17:06] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:07] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[17:07] <KillGradient> so you're up and running now?
[17:07] <bertox> no still not working, i got the same set of errors
[17:07] <KillGradient> ok 
[17:07] <bertox> although, it's hard for me to believe ALL of those ports are being used...
[17:07] <KillGradient> hey question about port forwarding on your router
[17:08] <KillGradient> did you forward to the ip of your machine, ie 192.168.1.233?
[17:08] <KillGradient> or did you use the same ip as you put in server.cfg?
[17:09] <KillGradient> i'm wondering if those ports are being used by other machines on the network, since we are binding the ports to our gateway ip.  this shouldn't matter should it?
[17:10] <KillGradient> don't think it even works that way, but i'm not sure
[17:10] <bertox> i used my local ip
[17:10] <KillGradient> i've seen torrent software open similar ports.
[17:11] <KillGradient> i assumed you've forwarded these https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8571-GLVN-8711
[17:11] <KillGradient> and 27960-27969
[17:11] <KillGradient> any others?
[17:12] <bertox> the latter but not the former
[17:12] <bertox> and 27010-27013
[17:12] <bertox> for steam servers, according to the tutorial
[17:13] <KillGradient> which tut are you following?
[17:13] <bertox> same one you are, that was in the troubleshooting section
[17:13] <bertox> step 1
[17:13] <bertox> and step 2
[17:17] * KillGradient has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[17:19] * KillGradient has joined #qldedsrv
[17:19] <KillGradient> weird thing is when i run top, qzeroded.x86 is shown to be running
[17:19] <KillGradient> but nothing is listening on the ports
[17:20] <KillGradient> obviously this is because the ports can't be bound
[17:20] <bertox> i checked windows firewall, and you can select "outbound" and add a new rule to allow those ports
[17:20] <bertox> i added them now, reboot the server
[17:21] <KillGradient> i wonder if it's because i'm not running ubuntu server.  maybe i'm missing some required server utility
[17:21] <bertox> i am however
[17:21] <bertox> still no dice
[17:21] * Rick971_ has joined #qldedsrv
[17:22] <KillGradient> you launch the server with ./run_server_x86.sh
[17:22] <KillGradient> i'm not using any modifiers, just editing server.cfg
[17:22] <KillGradient> same with you?
[17:22] <bertox> yeah, i using the x64 shell script though
[17:22] <noobieone[solo]> you can launch both x64 and x86?
[17:23] <noobieone[solo]> or just one
[17:23] <bertox> i'm only launching x64
[17:23] <noobieone[solo]> hmm
[17:23] <noobieone[solo]> i need to check with my server
[17:23] <KillGradient> no i can launch both
[17:23] <KillGradient> same results
[17:24] <KillGradient> they just said x86 is the stable option, and since i'm experiencing problems i'm trying it first
[17:24] <roasticle> only parameter i use is fs_basepath
[17:24] <noobieone[solo]> i am setting my server up as we speak
[17:24] <noobieone[solo]> running ubuntu 14.04
[17:24] <bertox> turned off firewall and anti virus. opened up all the required ports on both TCP and UDP, same error
[17:25] <noobieone[solo]> you running windows?
[17:25] <KillGradient> no i'm running xubuntu 14.04 on bare metal
[17:25] <KillGradient> figured after i get this simple configuration working i'd expand to esxi and shit
[17:25] <KillGradient> or so i thought.  this is outrageous
[17:26] * PerpetualWa_off is now known as PerpetualWar
[17:26] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[17:26] <noobieone[solo]> i am also running it on bare metal
[17:26] <bertox> i'll try with x86
[17:26] <noobieone[solo]> it's little overated server :)
[17:27] <bertox> same error lol
[17:28] <KillGradient> i think you were onto something seracing
[17:28] <KillGradient> UDP_OpenSocket: unable to bind ubuntu
[17:28] <KillGradient> in google
[17:30] <bertox> hmm
[17:31] <bertox> ok will try that search
[17:31] * PerpetualWar is now known as PerpetualWa_off
[17:32] <bertox> "That basically means that your ip should be the internal ip of the ubuntu machine. So your problem is not in the +ip parameter. It should be +ip 192.168.1.23 It appears to me that you do not have your ports forwarded all the way."
[17:32] <KillGradient> yep i'm seeing the same thing
[17:32] <bertox> sort of contradicts what yakumo was saying
[17:32] <KillGradient> but what sense does that make?
[17:33] <KillGradient> yeah so we need to forward to the "internet" ip, in our case, our gateway, correct?
[17:33] <KillGradient> i've just tried a port testing tool, and it says ports aren't open, period.
[17:33] <KillGradient> http://www.canyouseeme.org/

[17:34] <noobieone[solo]> i wil check
[17:35] <noobieone[solo]> nice it's working :)
[17:35] <noobieone[solo]> but is't ffa 
[17:35] <noobieone[solo]> need to change it to CA how do i do that?
[17:36] <KillGradient> you got it to work by changing your port forwarding address from your server's local ip to your gateway ip?

[17:39] <KillGradient> bertox?
[17:39] <noobieone[solo]> anyone having problems with match browers in ql?
[17:40] <KillGradient> you can't see yours?
[17:40] <noobieone[solo]> it's not showing any
[17:40] <noobieone[solo]> ...
[17:40] <bertox> type net_ip
[17:40] <bertox> what is the response
[17:40] <bertox> @KillGradient still working on a solution
[17:41] <bertox> seems it could be related to VirtualBox junk
[17:41] <KillGradient> @noobieone  i can see the servers.  make sure you have filters turned off and that you're looking at internet, not lan
[17:42] <noobieone[solo]> they are off don't know why this is
[17:42] <KillGradient> you changed your port forwarding, and no results?
[17:42] <KillGradient> restart steam, noobie
[17:42] <noobieone[solo]> i will try that
[17:42] <noobieone[solo]> thank you
[17:44] <KillGradient> you know, i'm half tempted to try all this on a redhat distro like centos or suse lol
[17:44] <noobieone[solo]> i did that too
[17:44] <noobieone[solo]> centos
[17:44] <KillGradient> i don't get rpm stuff like i do debian
[17:45] <noobieone[solo]> didn't work for me
[17:45] <noobieone[solo]> switched back to ubuntu
[17:45] <KillGradient> wait noobie i thought you said your server worked?
[17:45] <noobieone[solo]> yes
[17:45] <noobieone[solo]> i could connect
[17:45] <KillGradient> what'd you do to make it work?
[17:45] <noobieone[solo]> only the changed the system settings  in the server.cfg
[17:46] <KillGradient> weren't you having the same problem as we were with the port binding?
[17:46] <KillGradient> like did you set your port to 27960, net_strict 0, and net_ip to your gateway?
[17:46] <KillGradient> or what?
[17:47] <noobieone[solo]> i had problems installed steacmd under steam user
[17:47] <KillGradient> that's it lol?
[17:47] <noobieone[solo]> had to install it under root
[17:47] <noobieone[solo]> yes
[17:48] <KillGradient> installed under root, but your file path is within the steam user, right?
[17:48] <noobieone[solo]> noo
[17:48] <noobieone[solo]> also root
[17:48] <KillGradient> both?
[17:48] <noobieone[solo]> yes
[17:48] <KillGradient> sooooo....
[17:48] <KillGradient> you lauch the server from steam user?
[17:48] <noobieone[solo]> no
[17:48] <noobieone[solo]> also root :)
[17:49] <KillGradient> so the script run_server_x86 expects a steam user and populated files
[17:49] <noobieone[solo]> i skipped the steam user part
[17:49] <KillGradient> i think you lost me
[17:50] <noobieone[solo]> what do you mean
[17:50] <KillGradient> you said 'i had problems installed steamcmd under steam user' i thought you meant that by installing steamcmd under steam user you solved the problme
[17:50] <sponge-> don't launch the server under root, that is insane and bad
[17:51] <KillGradient> but you meant you had problems with this method
[17:51] <KillGradient> we know, but for simplicity sake it's easier.  plus i'm just concerned with getting the damn thing to run
[17:51] <KillGradient> i'll set it up right once that happens, if it ever does :(
[17:51] <sponge-> it's not easier. just unzip steamcmd to your home dir, install the ds to your home dir
[17:51] <sponge-> you dont need root for any step of the process
[17:52] <KillGradient> actually that's what i did
[17:52] <KillGradient> we're saying root, but meaning default user
[17:52] <KillGradient> we aren't sudo'ing anything
[17:52] <noobieone[solo]> that rights
[17:54] <noobieone[solo]> i know i must not run the server under root i was just checking if i was doing something wrong
[17:54] <KillGradient> noobie you only modified system settings, correct.  i'll post mine, verify them for me plz
[17:54] <KillGradient> set net_strict "0"
[17:54] <noobieone[solo]> sure
[17:54] <KillGradient> set net_ip "98.157.xx.xxx"
[17:54] <KillGradient> set net_port "27960"
[17:55] <KillGradient> set sv_serverType "2"
[17:55] * Rick971_ has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:55] <Kal> you should +set net_strict 1
[17:55] <KillGradient> set sv_master "1"
[17:55] <KillGradient> that it?
[17:55] * Rick971_ has joined #qldedsrv
[17:55] <KillGradient> setting master to 1...
[17:56] <KillGradient> that fuckin did it
[17:56] <KillGradient> kal ty
[17:56] <bertox> your server is working now?
[17:56] <bertox> my sv_master was already 1 hah
[17:57] <noobieone[solo]> set net_strict "1
[17:57] <KillGradient> well let me verify real quick
[17:57] <KillGradient> i don't see it in quake live match browser, but i'm going to read the cmd logs
[17:57] <KillGradient> wait wait wait
[17:58] <noobieone[solo]> me neither but i don't see any servers
[17:58] <KillGradient> cannot assign port  to requested address
[17:58] <KillGradient> same problem
[17:58] <KillGradient> noobie scroll up and read in your console do you see the same error
[17:58] <Kal> something already using that port then
[17:58] <KillGradient> or does it show the port has been successfully mapped?
[17:59] <KillGradient> what's the solution kal?  we've been focusing on that for a little over an hour, but come up empty
[17:59] <noobieone[solo]> no i don't
[17:59] <Kal> restart the server
[17:59] <noobieone[solo]> maybe you already runnnig the same script
[17:59] <KillGradient> ok.  it'll take a minute lol
[17:59] <noobieone[solo]> that;'s why
[18:00] <KillGradient> yeah i've been applying all kinds of configs, but just been stopping the server with ctrl+c
[18:00] <KillGradient> rebooting atm...
[18:00] <noobieone[solo]> aaah alright
[18:00] <KillGradient> bought a dell poweredge just for the fun of this, so it takes a good minute to start
[18:01] <KillGradient> this experience is robbing my fun tho lol
[18:01] <noobieone[solo]> hehe
[18:01] <noobieone[solo]> i have the HP DL360 G9 
[18:01] <KillGradient> aw hell yeah nice
[18:01] <KillGradient> poweredge 2950
[18:01] <noobieone[solo]> with 2x E5-2650V3
[18:01] <noobieone[solo]> with 2x E5-2640V3
[18:01] <noobieone[solo]> i am
[18:01] <KillGradient> arrived broken.  got a refund and the guy didn't even want it back cause of shipping cost
[18:02] <KillGradient> bought a new raid controller for 15 bucks and bam works
[18:02] <KillGradient> 15 dollar server
[18:02] <noobieone[solo]> hehe
[18:02] <noobieone[solo]> nice
[18:02] <noobieone[solo]> well i work for ISP  so I have free servers :)
[18:03] <KillGradient> hey you guys. i'm getting the same error
[18:03] <noobieone[solo]> hmm
[18:03] <KillGradient> verbatim:  
[18:03] <KillGradient> ERROR: UDP OpenSocket: bind: cannot assign requested address
[18:04] <KillGradient> noobie you're port forwarding?
[18:04] <KillGradient> are you forwarding the machine's local ip or your gateway ip?
[18:04] <Kal> firewall blocking outgoing?
[18:04] <KillGradient> i don't have firewall enabled
[18:04] <KillGradient> xubuntu 14.04
[18:04] <KillGradient> vanilla install
[18:05] <Kal> have you tried not setting net_ip and just net_port?
[18:05] <noobieone[solo]> noo  port forwaring here
[18:05] <KillGradient> yes.  oddly it assigns me 127.0.1.1
[18:05] <Kal> thats fine
[18:05] <bertox> KillGradient
[18:05] <Kal> should still use your main IP for internet
[18:05] <bertox> i checked my router, and it showed a different local ip for me
[18:05] <bertox> for the ubuntu server
[18:06] <Kal> could be an issue with your networking then for whatever IP your trying to bind to with net_ip
[18:06] <KillGradient> can you elaborate kal?
[18:06] <bertox> well that canyouseeme.org is still saying port 27960 is not open
[18:07] <bertox> however my router has it open
[18:07] * mikul has quit IRC (EOF from client)
[18:07] <bertox> or "forwarded" for more correct termonology
[18:07] <KillGradient> that website also shows your ip
[18:07] <Kal> if it works when net_ip is not set then that would indicate there is an issue with whatever IP your trying to bind to with net_ip
[18:08] <KillGradient> oh ok thank you kal
[18:08] <bertox> the VM and the OS have the same ip, would that cause an issue?
[18:08] <KillGradient> WIll the server be actually running if it binds 127.0.1.1 and port 27960, and the server proceeds to launch.
[18:08] <KillGradient> or are you saying i must address the issues with the ip to which i'm trying to bind?
[18:09] <Kal> it should yes
[18:09] <Kal> if that machine has internet access
[18:09] * PerpetualWa_off is now known as PerpetualWar
[18:10] <KillGradient> it has access.  when i run netstat -an | grep "LISTEN" there is nothing listening on 27960
[18:10] <KillGradient> this is with the server running and showing as such in top
[18:10] <KillGradient> with net_ip blank, of course
[18:10] <Kal> what is the public IP for that server?
[18:11] <KillGradient> 98.157.64.148
[18:11] <KillGradient> that matches my gateway, btw
[18:11] * mikul has joined #qldedsrv
[18:11] <Kal> 90 98.157.64.148:27960
[18:12] <Kal> your server is in steams master list
[18:12] <KillGradient> srsly?
[18:12] <Kal> yes
[18:12] <bertox> wait, so make net_ip blank?
[18:13] <KillGradient> then why isn't it showing on ql match browser?
[18:13] <KillGradient> that's what he says, bertox
[18:13] <KillGradient> the server name is 'Roseanne' lol
[18:13] <Kal> see if you can /connect to it in ql too to verify its up
[18:13] <KillGradient> it's not there
[18:14] <KillGradient> how do i do that? 
[18:14] <KillGradient> i'm used to just hitting the match browser
[18:14] <Kal>  /connect 98.157.64.148
[18:14] <KillGradient> sec..
[18:14] <bertox> net_ip is set to localhost
[18:14] <bertox> server running
[18:14] <Kal> \o/
[18:15] <bertox> shouldn't it be a WAN ip though?
[18:15] <Kal> it will use the wan ip for all outbound connections
[18:15] <bertox> i was at this point before, but same issue as KillGradient, didn't see it in the ql server list
[18:16] <bertox> refreshed it this morning with these settings after letting it run all night, and still wasn't there
[18:16] <Kal> that im unsure.. may be a filter issue
[18:16] <noobieone[solo]> you can add the server to server list 
[18:16] * G1N-zurn is now known as zurn
[18:16] <noobieone[solo]> you will see the server
[18:17] * KillGradient has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
[18:17] <noobieone[solo]> to favorites
[18:17] * KillGradient has joined #qldedsrv
[18:17] <noobieone[solo]> i didn;t see my either
[18:17] <KillGradient> when i run /connect i get a bad server address error
[18:18] <noobieone[solo]> how do you shutdown the server?
[18:18] <Kal> sounds like a networking issue of some kind
[18:18] <noobieone[solo]> just kill the process?
[18:18] * b1ngo|offline is now known as b1ngo
[18:19] <bertox> Kal
[18:19] <bertox> noticed i don't see my server in the server list
[18:19] <KillGradient> wait how come bertox can assign his ip to his gateway, but i have to leave it blank?
[18:19] <bertox> and /connect ip sits at Awaiting connection for days
[18:19] <bertox> that's /connect <insert ip> for clarity
[18:19] <KillGradient> same
[18:19] <KillGradient> it's gotta be a networking problem
[18:19] <Kal> yeah you got a networking problem then
[18:20] <bertox> KillGradient, i also left the ip blank\
[18:20] <KillGradient> oh ok
[18:20] <KillGradient> umm
[18:20] <KillGradient> seems noobie question, but in the light of things
[18:20] <KillGradient> which ip do you port forward then?
[18:20] <KillGradient> local machine 192.168.1.xxx
[18:20] <KillGradient> or 127.0.1.1
[18:20] <Kal> 192.168
[18:20] <KillGradient> or even 98.157.64.148?
[18:21] <KillGradient> ok i'll try that
[18:23] <KillGradient> alright gonna reset connections and server...brb 
[18:23] * crobartie has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[18:25] <bertox> fyi
[18:25] <bertox> if i change my net_ip to x.x.x.x:27960 i don't get that UDP port error
[18:25] <bertox> and the server starts
[18:26] <bertox> not sure if that is totally incorrect or what
[18:27] * tjone270 sets mode: +v Kal
[18:28] <Kal> bertox: can you /connect to it now?
[18:29] * KillGradient has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
[18:29] * KillGradient has joined #qldedsrv
[18:29] <bertox> no, seems like that ip is not correct. or false positive. ifconfig shows the ubuntu server ip as 10.0.2.15 for me
[18:29] <KillGradient> alright back
[18:29] <bertox> set that for the net_ip, and that worked
[18:30] <bertox> server started, don't see it in the list though
[18:30] <KillGradient> jw is the reason my server isn't showing up in ql because i haven't assigned a gametype, etc?
[18:30] <KillGradient> i'm just running off stock config
[18:31] <Kal> whats your public ip bertox?
[18:32] <bertox> 73.36.56.11
[18:32] <bertox> does the net_ip for local need to be IPv4?
[18:32] <Kal> yours isn't in steams master list
[18:33] <bertox> correct
[18:33] <KillGradient> kal is mine still in the list?  98.157.64.148
[18:33] <Kal> KillGradient: yes
[18:34] <Kal> i think so bertox
[18:34] <KillGradient> ok well i used the /connect command and it says awaiting connection
[18:34] <KillGradient> because i haven't setup a gametype?
[18:34] <KillGradient> awaiting connection 25... lol
[18:35] <Kal> idk, does your console log shed any light on the issue?
[18:35] * vtchill has joined #qldedsrv
[18:35] <KillGradient> server console?
[18:35] <KillGradient> not really
[18:36] <Kal> sounds like you still have a networking issue then if you can't /connect
[18:36] <bertox> YES is ee it
[18:36] <bertox> kill are you using virtualbox?
[18:36] <KillGradient> nope i'm running xubuntu 14.04 on bare metal
[18:36] <bertox> ok
[18:36] <KillGradient> bertox which server are you seeing?
[18:37] <bertox> NOML Duel Chicago, that is mine
[18:37] <KillGradient> man...
[18:37] <bertox> I had to change my network settings in virtualbox, may be the same issue for you
[18:37] <KillGradient> what'd you change?
[18:37] <bertox> default was set to NAT, i changed it to bridge connections, then restarted the machine
[18:37] <bertox> i noticed that in the router settings it showed my ubuntu server not connected
[18:38] <bertox> that is when i changed the network adapter settings for the VM, and it worked afterwards
[18:38] <KillGradient> well i'm running through a router, obviously
[18:38] <KillGradient> but not a vm router
[18:38] <bertox> also my VM ifconfig was not reporting the correct local ip
[18:38] <KillGradient> i'm running through a pfsense box
[18:38] <KillGradient> oh
[18:38] <bertox> it was reporting 10.0.2.15 for the local ip, but the router showed it as 10.0.0.7
[18:38] <KillGradient> incorrect ip?
[18:38] <KillGradient> what'd you do to fix
[18:38] <bertox> i updated my net_ip to 10.0.0.7
[18:38] <KillGradient> the ip of your machine, or your public ip?
[18:39] <KillGradient> i can try switching to 127.0.0.1 instead of 127.0.1.1
[18:39] <bertox> 127.0.0.1 is localhost, i think Kal is correct with his assumption it should be your 198.x.x.x ip
[18:39] <bertox> analogous to my 10.0.0.7
[18:41] <KillGradient> i've tried that, remember?  get the port binding error when i set net_ip to "192.168.1.xxx"
[18:42] <KillGradient> i assume that's the ip as your local network sees it?
[18:43] <bertox> make sure that port is forwarded for that machine
[18:43] * McAfee has joined #qldedsrv
[18:43] <KillGradient> it is forwarded.
[18:43] <bertox> i had to change my port forward for the 10.x.x.7 address
[18:43] <McAfee> x.x   :o
[18:43] <KillGradient> how do you check the steam server status like kal has been doing?
[18:44] <McAfee> waddup, i'm latre
[18:44] <McAfee> late*
[18:44] <KillGradient> welcome, mcafee
[18:45] <McAfee> Back once again for the renegade master
[18:45] <Kal> i have a script that polls the master list
[18:45] <bertox> select steam icon > servers > filter for QL
[18:45] <KillGradient> bertox what command did you use to check your ip in ubuntu?
[18:45] <bertox> that's what I did
[18:45] <bertox> ifconfig (but I had to go to the router and check connections for the actual ip of the VM)
[18:46] <McAfee> you can probably use predathor's server browser and make sure you are filtering timedout servers
[18:46] <McAfee> not filtering*
[18:47] <KillGradient> after running ifconfig did you look for inet addr or bcast?
[18:48] <noobieone[solo]> can someone tell me where to change the game mod? in server.cfg or in the factories script?
[18:48] <McAfee> What seems to be your boggle?
[18:49] <McAfee> noobieone[solo] mappool ?
[18:49] <noobieone[solo]> ca
[18:49] <noobieone[solo]> i want to change gametype
[18:49] <noobieone[solo]> server is starting in FFA
[18:49] <McAfee> sv_mappoolfile
[18:49] <Kal> ^
[18:50] <McAfee> it would be in your server.cfg
[18:50] * Q sets mode: +v McAfee
[18:50] <noobieone[solo]> hmm
[18:50] <noobieone[solo]> let me check again
[18:50] <McAfee> thanks Q xD
[18:50] <tjone270> :)
[18:50] <McAfee> does Q give me one of those 007 cars?
[18:50] <Kal> i wish
[18:50] <KillGradient> so simply changing to mappool_ca will make all my games run with the ca gametype, not just maps?
[18:51] <noobieone[solo]> good question
[18:51] <noobieone[solo]> i was thinking about that too
[18:51] <McAfee> the mappool txt file will have list of maps and the factory to run them, in the case of the provided mappool_ca they are all ca :)
[18:51] <McAfee> mind you, people can still vote what you allow them to vote
[18:52] <KillGradient> ah thank you
[18:52] <noobieone[solo]> i don't want people to for other gametypes so
[18:52] <noobieone[solo]> vote
[18:52] <noobieone[solo]> i mean
[18:52] <noobieone[solo]> so have to change it in the factory file?
[18:53] <McAfee> most of what you want will be on your server.cfg
[18:53] <McAfee> you want a mappool that only has CA, you want to disable gametype voting (see g_voteFlags, 8th bit)
[18:54] <noobieone[solo]> thank you i will check again
[19:01] <KillGradient> ok still having issues, but thanks much for your help

[21:22] <Yakumo`> and can anyone else test LAN servers on their LAN ? (no VM's pls) 
[21:24] <McAfee> i was one
[21:28] <Yakumo`> ta, what IP range is your network ?
[21:28] <Yakumo`> I either forgot to ask last time, or it's logged on a different machine :/
[21:28] <McAfee> 10.0.0.x
[21:28] <Yakumo`> ta
[21:28] <McAfee> sometimes when the server connects, it shows the longip on the UI
[21:29] <McAfee> eg: 10*256^3 + ....
[21:30] <Yakumo`> ye
[21:30] <Yakumo`> only sometimes though? that's odd
[21:34] <McAfee> testing again
[21:35] <Yakumo`> <@sponge-> connect shows you exactly what is passed into it
[21:38] <McAfee> i have the server in my favorites, and i connect from the builtin browser using that
[21:39] <McAfee> this might be relevant:   Opening IP socket: localhost:27964     Hostname: ubuntu     IP: 127.0.1.1
[21:41] <McAfee> ifconfig only shows my eth1 on 10.0.0.103 and loopback on 127.0.0.1
[21:41] <McAfee> idk where it's getting 127.0.1.1 from
[21:42] <McAfee> hmm, maybe /etc/hosts?
[21:43] <Yakumo`> sponge- ^

[23:38] <McAfee> is there a way to make the windows server run as a daemon or hidden, and then use an alternate terminal/rcon to connect to it, avoiding all the issues with hitches
[23:38] <sponge-> nope! another reason why the windows server is bad

[23:44] <Drayan> someone could probably make a launcher that does that

[23:46] <McAfee> what does vac have to do with the question
[23:46] <McAfee> :/
[23:46] <Drayan> well you'd need to inject a DLL
[23:47] <Drayan> or the way I'd do it would be to inject a DLL
[23:47] <Drayan> which VAC might not like
[23:47] <McAfee> ah
[23:47] <Drayan> probably possible without, but with two .exe's running
[23:48] <McAfee> thing is, historically, the UI to the windows server for idtech3 was not very awesome
[23:48] <McAfee> i'm trying to see if any game to ever use idtech3, make a workaround to it
[23:48] <Drayan> indeed, you can hide the window and code your own UI though
[23:49] <McAfee> we dont even get tab completion on the windows UI

[00:08] <roasticle> turn on show full url in steam settings if you dont have it on

[00:50] <bertox> couple user's voted a map not in the default map pool, but it changed the gametype. is there a way to always keep the gametype?
[00:52] <noobieone[solo]> wierd i haven't tried that yet
[00:52] <noobieone[solo]> let me check on my server
[00:53] <[ByQ]Descent> they voted "callvote map bloodrun ffa"
[00:53] <[ByQ]Descent> change vote flags
[00:53] <noobieone[solo]> yes
[00:53] <bertox> yeah do i have to lower the vote flag?
[00:53] <noobieone[solo]> i have it on 8
[00:53] <bertox> i have it set to allow kick
[00:54] <noobieone[solo]> nope it's not working here
[00:54] <bertox> k i
[00:54] <bertox> i'll put it to 8
[00:55] <vtchill> you have to add the values together of things you want to disable
[00:55] <bertox> yes i recognize the pattern
[00:55] <noobieone[solo]> :)
[00:55] <vtchill> i set my servers to 13320 for instance
[00:55] <noobieone[solo]> why?
[00:56] <vtchill> disables loadouts, global ammo, some other stuff and choosing diferent gametypes
[00:56] <noobieone[solo]> hmm
[00:56] <vtchill> disables timers i think too
[00:56] <noobieone[solo]> I will try that one :)
[00:58] <vtchill> yep item timers, global ammo, loadouts, and gametype is what that will disable
[01:00] * g0rilla has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:00] <bertox> possible to reload the server.cfg without a server restart?
[01:00] <McAfee> exec it
[01:01] <bertox> k just checking
[01:01] <McAfee> then do a map change using \map
[01:02] <McAfee> this is my voteflags:    set g_voteFlags "30058"    // 2+8+32+64+256+1024+4096+8192+16384
[01:02] <vtchill> what is 16384?
[01:02] <McAfee> weaprespawn
[01:02] <vtchill> i dont see it listed in the server config example
[01:03] <McAfee> it's not, but it shows up on the list of \\callvote
[01:03] <McAfee> \callvote*
[01:03] <bertox> i've got mine set to 23
[01:03] <bertox> map, restart, vote kick, nextmap
[01:04] <vtchill> you want to disable those only?
[01:04] <bertox> enable those only
[01:04] <vtchill> its the opposite
[01:04] <McAfee> bertox, i think you want it the other way around
[01:04] <vtchill> its a disable flag
[01:04] <bertox> ah crap
[01:04] <sponge-> adding the bit in voteflags disables the vote
[01:04] <McAfee> probably 32765 - 23 
[01:04] <McAfee> if my math is correct
[01:05] <McAfee> 32742
[01:05] <bertox> yeah just updated it
[01:05] <vtchill> how do you exec a server config?
[01:05] <McAfee> you might need to verify that
[01:05] <McAfee> exec server.cfg
[01:05] <bertox> yeah
[01:06] <McAfee> followed by a map change for good measure
[01:06] <vtchill> how would you do that running on a vps?
[01:06] <McAfee> depends how you launched, admin has rcon by default too
[01:06] <McAfee> i think
[01:06] <noobieone[solo]> i asume in console :)
[01:07] <McAfee> so an admin should be able to: rcon exec server.cfg   then rcon map campgrounds
[01:07] <vtchill> its launched with supervisor on a remote server so i dont have server.cfg local
[01:07] <sponge-> server.cfg is exec'd automatically
[01:07] <vtchill> yea i would assume rcon would be the way to do it
[01:07] <noobieone[solo]> i run ssh on the server 
[01:07] <sponge-> just rcon quit if you want to reload your srever config
[01:07] <McAfee> that command is run on the server, it's not going find files locally to do it
[01:08] <noobieone[solo]> and do it from there
[01:08] <McAfee> that's if your server is configured to relaunch on exit :)
[01:08] <vtchill> but dont you need ql running on the remote server to exec it, if you dont use rcon
[01:09] <vtchill> if i run exec filename on my local machine its going to look locally to exec that file
[01:09] <McAfee> not if it has rcon before it
[01:09] <vtchill> yea of course with rcon it will work
[01:09] <McAfee> you can either shutdown the server and launch it again, or use rcon to change things on the fly
[01:09] <vtchill> i usually just reboot the server instance completely like sponge- said
[01:10] <vtchill> since its supervisor i can stop and restart it pretty quick
[01:10] <McAfee> but it's good info to know you dont always need to kill it, maybe you want to update something and dont want to kick all your players out.
[01:12] <sponge-> you can rcon exec server.cfg but there's latched cvars and cvars that are only on launch and so on
[01:12] <sponge-> so it won't get you in the same state necessarily
[01:12] <vtchill> yea i thought that might be the case

[01:32] <lonewulf> Any Idea(s) on why I would be getting Hitch warnings in rcon console at Chicago, but not one Hitch warning in Dallas?
[01:32] <lonewulf> Same VPS..
[01:32] <lonewulf> Same OS
[01:33] <lonewulf> Ubuntu 14.04
[01:33] <lonewulf> Same packages everything.
[01:34] <kanzo> different node
[01:34] <lonewulf> hmm
[01:34] <lonewulf> can you tell me more?
[01:37] <lonewulf> I lose the rcon in Chicago sometimes as well
[01:37] <lonewulf> but never in Dallas 
[01:37] <kanzo> node is the actual server which hosts x amount of VPSs, maybe high load on the one you are on or other issue
[01:37] <lonewulf> I've googled Hitch warning and not much out there 
[01:37] <lonewulf> most say to reboot
[01:38] <lonewulf> but that does not help me
[01:38] <kanzo> how often do you get them
[01:38] <lonewulf> everyday
[01:38] <lonewulf> only in Chi
[01:38] <lonewulf> sometimes I lose rcon there as well
[01:39] <lonewulf> in Chi I mean.
[01:39] <lonewulf> I lose the rcon access in console
[01:39] <lonewulf> not client.
[01:39] <lonewulf> like it freezes
[01:39] <lonewulf> doesnt ever come back 
[01:39] <lonewulf> I've let it set before
[01:39] <lonewulf> on happens in Chicago.
[01:39] <lonewulf> maybe I should reach out to my VPS?
[01:40] <lonewulf> see if they will reset my server manually or whatever?
[01:40] <kanzo> how many msec is it
[01:40] <lonewulf> varys
[01:40] <lonewulf> but it lags the game
[01:40] <lonewulf> one was so long it lasted minutes
[01:41] <lonewulf> the Hitch warnings come and go
[01:41] <kanzo> should say hitch warning x msec frame time
[01:41] <lonewulf> some lag the game more than others
[01:41] <lonewulf> yes it does
[01:41] <lonewulf> I see them every day
[01:41] <lonewulf> and night.
[01:41] <kanzo> and what is the value of x on average
[01:41] <lonewulf> no clue
[01:42] <lonewulf> they almost always lag/freeze the game if you're in-game playing.
[01:43] <lonewulf> I'll open a ticket with my VPS.
[01:43] <lonewulf> since it happens in Chi, but not in their Dallas location.
[01:43] <lonewulf> maybe they will switch nodes for me
[01:43] <lonewulf> or whatever.
[01:44] <kanzo> i think most hitch warning can be ignored but if you notice lag ingame then its different
[01:44] <kanzo> what is cpu usage
[01:44] <lonewulf> 5-10%
[01:44] <lonewulf> yeah, Ive read where most can be ignored 
[01:44] <lonewulf> but these can not
[01:44] <lonewulf> they stop/freeze the game.
[01:44] <lonewulf> I want my players to be happy.

[01:45] <lonewulf> only in Chi tho.

[01:47] <vtchill> yea the dallas ones are on par with ping as well, but the chi one you have is like 70 at best for me and i’m in CO
[01:48] <vtchill> and normally i’m 50 or so to chi servers

[01:48] <lonewulf> its normal for me
[01:48] <lonewulf> and others
[01:48] <vtchill> maybe 60 at the top but yours is consistently above that for me
[01:48] <kanzo> how is your ping to il.qlrace.com vtchill?
[01:48] <lonewulf> one time I had 20 ping to my vultr Chi 
[01:48] <lonewulf> not sure how that happened.
[01:48] <vtchill> one sec will check
[01:49] <kanzo> thxx
[01:49] <lonewulf> kanzo: yeah Vultr responds almost before you're done sending
[01:49] <lonewulf> lol, its pretty quick.
[01:50] <vtchill> 45-55 kanzo 
[01:50] <lonewulf> vtchill: I just rebooted my Chi VPS not too long ago... you should try again.
[01:52] <snipe> lonewulf: in top do you see high st% ?
[01:52] <lonewulf> whats st?

[01:52] <lonewulf> my htop looks nice
[01:52] <snipe> htop doesn't have st i do not think
[01:53] <snipe> st being steal / shared hosting

[01:53] <lonewulf> lol
[01:53] <lonewulf> its bad
[01:53] <lonewulf> snipe: guess I'll install top?
[01:54] <lonewulf> :o
[01:54] <snipe> should be installed
[01:54] <snipe> comes in procps which is a ton of utilities

[01:55] * noobieone[solo] has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[01:56] <lonewulf> snipe: so to answer you.. no
[01:56] <lonewulf> not high st%
[01:56] <lonewulf> :D
[01:57] <snipe> see if the hitch warning timings line up with any sort of spike (load or cpu/st%) if not then something is very off with that dom0 host (machine running the vps)
[01:58] <lonewulf> snipe: kk
[01:58] <lonewulf> Hey let me just reach out to my VPS
[01:58] <lonewulf> maybe they can fix
[01:58] <snipe> as them if they can move your instance to a different node
[01:58] <snipe> ask*
[01:58] <lonewulf> kk
[01:58] <snipe> they might do this upon reboot similar to aws but who knows
[01:58] <lonewulf> please can you move my instance to a diff node.. gotcha.
[02:02] <snipe> also did you adjust sv_fps at all?
[02:03] <snipe> basically the warning iirc is todo with late frames are processed wrt sv_fps rate
[02:03] <snipe> so during initial load + map changes it makes sense otherwise there should be none
[02:03] <lonewulf> snipe: no i havent.
[02:04] <lonewulf> same setup and packages on my Chicago,and Dallas servers.
[02:04] <lonewulf> Mirrored.
[02:04] <vtchill> lonewulf’s servers anywhere from 50-80
[02:05] <lonewulf> vtchill: wow
[02:05] <vtchill> yep just refreshed, best is 55 worst is 78
[02:05] <lonewulf> Im sending now to Vultr..will Update: later.

[18:22] <sponge-> so, any objections to locking sv_fps in the next build? because i'm pretty sure that's the way i'm going!
[18:23] <roasticle> to 40?
[18:23] <sponge-> yup
[18:23] <roasticle> sure, since its unstable otherwise :P
[18:23] <McAfee> i'd vote lock it unless devmap is on :P
[18:24] <sponge-> weapon rate of fire being inconsistent is probably enough justification alone. but breaking antilag is just icing on the cake
[18:24] <sponge-> it's not going to be a callvote, that's insane
[18:24] <McAfee> i mean, make it a cheat protected cvar
[18:24] <roasticle> i liked sv_fps 125, but server crashing no thx!
[18:25] <McAfee> then someone could in theory still play around with it using devmap?
[18:25] <sponge-> people have had a month to play around with it, i think it's lack of benefits are now clear
[18:26] * wmia3p5card has joined #qldedsrv
[18:33] <McAfee> predathor's browser doesn't seem to expose the variable, is it not shown to the client?
[18:34] <McAfee> was curious how many servers were still trying to go with 125
[18:34] <sponge-> nope, that was done on purpose so people can't taint their judgment by looking at /serverinfo
[18:36] * vtchill has joined #qldedsrv
[18:37] <McAfee> judging by the name, 5 "groups" of servers, not counting multiple servers from the same clan/admin

[18:53] <noobieone[solo]> Hello can someone help me I can't become admin on my own server, I have added my steamid|admin to the access file but i am still not admin
[18:55] <kanzo> check acces.txt in fs_homepath/baseq3 default homepath is ~/.quakelive/
[18:56] <kanzo> access.txt
[18:58] <noobieone[solo]> hmm i have edit the access.txt in /baseq3 
[18:58] <zar-> sponge-: definitely lock it. I've played with it a lot; no reason to make it >40
[18:58] <zar-> and <40 is unstable
[18:58] * Dbzruler72 has joined #qldedsrv
[18:58] <kanzo> yes in the qlds directory, but you can either delete the one in ~/.quakelive so it will copy over the new one or edit the one in ~/.quakelive
[18:59] <zar-> sponge-: on the match browser in the client though, it'd be nice if the ping didn't update on click, because it changes the order of the servers
[18:59] <roasticle> why do people like to say "the netcode is broken" so much
[18:59] * Rick971 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:00] <sponge-> zar-: hm it shouldn't be, at one point that was working
[19:00] <noobieone[solo]> i don't remember seeying the ~./quakelive 
[19:00] <noobieone[solo]> where is it located?
[19:00] * bertox has joined #qldedsrv
[19:00] <kanzo> cd ~/.quakelive
[19:01] <noobieone[solo]> tes
[19:01] <noobieone[solo]> yes found it :)
[19:01] <noobieone[solo]> thank :)
[19:01] <kanzo> directory with . as first character is hidden
[19:02] * Rick971 has joined #qldedsrv
[19:02] <kanzo> so wont show on ls, ls -a shows hidden files/directories
[19:02] <noobieone[solo]> aah that's why :)
[19:02] <noobieone[solo]> thank you :)
[19:02] <noobieone[solo]> i will test it now :)
[19:03] <lonewulfn6> Update: All of my Hitch warnings are gone..thanks to all who supported me through it.. 
[19:03] <lonewulfn6> VPS updated my node.
[19:04] <sponge-> client/server beta branches have been updated: fixed steam workshop regression, increased console historey size, and sv_fps is locked to 40
[19:04] <roasticle> christopher hitchens would be proud
[19:05] <lonewulfn6> )
[19:06] <lonewulfn6> Do we just opt in to Steam beta branches like before?
[19:06] <sponge-> yup
[19:06] <sponge-> http://steamcommunity.com/app/282440/discussions/0/485623406962851722/
[19:06] <sponge-> the cmdline for servers is in that post
[19:08] <lonewulf> Thank you Sir.
[19:09] <lonewulf> Im running 9 servers now (3 in Chicago, 3 in Dallas, 3 in Atlanta) on Vultr.com
[19:09] <lonewulf> Should check them out

[19:48] <McAfee> roasticle, they have to blame something for their lack of skills
[19:51] <McAfee> i'm pretty sure the next release notes could say: * Updated netcode, small changes to movement... But actually not change anything at all in the code, and the outcry will be HUGE!
[19:56] <sponge-> i got complaints about server routing when i edited the js on the old site
[20:01] <vtchill> sv_includeCurrentMapInVote, nice sponge- 
[20:01] <vtchill> well done
[20:10] <Drayan> is that the longest cvar name so far?
[20:10] <vtchill> :P
[20:11] <vtchill> will be very nice to duel, so much more convenient and quick to go back to current map
[20:15] <McAfee> should have been sv_icmiv :)
[20:19] <jaysson> where do this "idle players" come from that are on many duel servers for days that are only listed in the serverbrowser?
[20:19] <jaysson> and how to get rid of them? be it in the server browser or with a server setting?
[20:20] <Drayan> someone said it was a steam bug and happens in other games, but I dunno
[20:23] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[20:28] <McAfee> i'm not sure if predahtors browser suffers from the same bug
[20:28] <McAfee> but it might be using a different query method

[22:09] <Kal> not sure

[22:11] <Kal> :D
[22:11] <roasticle> oops scroll

[22:31] * pedreiro has joined #qldedsrv
[22:31] <pedreiro> where is the sound folder Mimobot?
[22:31] <pedreiro> linux server
[22:34] <tjone270> Do you mean 'minqlx'? 
[22:35] <pedreiro> yes
[22:36] <pedreiro> sound/vo/crash_new/37b_07_alt.wav
[22:36] <pedreiro> where is?
[22:36] <tjone270> The sound folder is located in the pak00.pk3 archive.
[22:37] <tjone270> Are you wanting to disable the MOTD sound, or change it, or something else?
[22:37] <carmethene> http://carmethene.com/ql/sound.txt
[22:37] <carmethene> there's a list of every sound in pak00.pk3
[22:37] <pedreiro> I want to change the folder
[22:37] <carmethene> first line of each group is the folder
[22:38] <carmethene> e.g. "sound/item/armorregen.ogg"
[22:39] <pedreiro> I want to put the country / minox / sound / has how?
[22:39] <tjone270> Unfortunately, you can't change the folder to one on your local system, well, you technically can, but as the sound files aren't present on the client, the sounds will not play, and the client will get an error message in the console.
[22:39] <pedreiro> ok
[22:40] <pedreiro> as I open the .pak file for me to listen?
[22:41] <tjone270> The pak00.pk3 file is just a ZIP archive, you can use the unzip utility on Linux, or rename the file to end in .zip on Windows, or open the file with Archive Utility in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Archive Utility.app on a Mac
[22:42] <pedreiro> ok thankyou
[22:44] <pedreiro> .ogg file works?
[22:44] <carmethene> yeah you can use the ogg files from the pk3
[22:44] <tjone270> Ogg (Vorbis) files can be played with VLC media player, they can be played using minqlx in-game with '!sound /path/to/ogg/file', omitting the .ogg extension in-game.
[22:53] <roasticle> ogg still exists eh

[21:35] <lonewulf> lol
[21:35] <lonewulf> got two guys on my Miami server talking about trading hacks with each other
[21:35] <lonewulf> lol
[21:35] <lonewulf> how do I log this?
[21:36] <lonewulf> rofl
[21:36] <lonewulf> Im lurking via the zmq_rcon.py
[21:36] <lonewulf> :)
[21:36] <lonewulf> this is amazing
[21:37] <lonewulf> they are are talking about which cheat bots they use.
[21:37] <McAfee> condump?
[21:37] <lonewulf> how?
[21:37] <lonewulf> logfile 2
[21:37] <lonewulf> ?
[21:37] <lonewulf> then what command?
[21:37] <lonewulf> then logfile 0 to turn back off?
[21:39] <McAfee> try condump
[21:40] <McAfee> are you gonna join the server?
[21:40] <lonewulf> they left
[21:40] <lonewulf> but I can copy the chat
[21:41] <lonewulf> thunderboss is one of the cheaters
[21:41] <lonewulf> rofl
[21:41] <lonewulf> this is too funny
[21:41] <lonewulf> and apparently some of these hacks cost money.
[21:42] <lonewulf> thunderboss just explained how he uses a ghosting hack to speed himself up
[21:42] <lonewulf> this is amazing.
[21:42] <lonewulf> just randomly looked at the console in Miami and noticed them talking about the cheats they use.
[21:42] <lonewulf> heh
[21:43] <McAfee> 107.191.51.74:27960
[21:44] <lonewulf> should I expose this cheater or what?
[21:44] <lonewulf> not sure what to do.
[21:45] <lonewulf> let me copy the chat manually real quick..at least.

[06:19] <roast> voice doesnt work on my server for some reason
[06:22] <syncore> look in /etc/network/interfaces
[06:22] <syncore> see if there is something like up ip addr add 10.x.x.x/16 dev eth0
[06:22] <syncore> if there is, remove it and ifdown eth0 then ifup eth0
[06:23] <syncore> should look like: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/26fbaa2587de5e988a05
[06:23] <roast> yeah it does have that
[06:23] <syncore> thats why voice doesnt work
[06:24] <roast> hm whats the purpose of that 
[06:24] <roast> line
[06:24] <syncore> it's some shit added by your VPS provider for support purposes

[06:25] <lonewulftp> What should I do with this conversation (about what cheats this guy uses, where to obtain, and how to pay for said cheat via paypal) I copied manually from my zmq_rcon.py? 
[06:26] <syncore> put it on pastebin for all to enjoy
[06:26] <lonewulftp> kk
[06:26] <syncore> well maybe remove the links
[06:26] <lonewulftp> give me about 20 mins..I'll come back with paste bin like URL.
[06:28] <lonewulftp> :)
[06:35] <roast> syncore: maybe i  shouldnt have did that in ssh hah
[06:35] <roast> fuckcakes my droplet is fuxored now
[06:40] <lonewulftp> What I'd really to do sometime..
[06:40] <lonewulftp> is share my qlds
[06:40] <lonewulftp> work-flow
[06:41] <lonewulftp> with you guys
[06:41] <lonewulftp> I have noone irl to share this with..

[06:43] <roast> its ok you can cry on sponges shoulder
[06:43] <roast> hes a sponge
[06:43] <lonewulftp> xD
[06:49] <roast> syncore: assuming i leave the x.x.x.x ips as is or is that a wildcard or something
[06:50] <roast> good thing i opted for DO backups
[06:50] <roast> and it did one last night whew
[06:50] <lonewulftp>  Buy a lottery ticket
[06:50] <lonewulftp> just one
[06:50] <syncore> what
[06:51] <syncore> i removed the line completely
[06:51] <syncore> just the 10.x one
[06:51] <syncore> no backup was needed. i just did that and restarted the server
[06:51] <syncore> vks originally posted this fix about a month ago
[06:51] <roast> my droplet just exploded
[06:51] <roast> you broke it!
[06:52] <syncore> you could restart it from the control panel
[06:52] <roast> didnt matter was getting errors on restart
[06:53] <roast> i just restored to last night nights backup
[06:53] <syncore> o
[06:55] <roast> its likely because last night i force upgraded to ubuntu 15 and hadnt restarted since
[06:55] <roast> and taking down eth0 forced me to restart
[06:55] <syncore> ah i see
[06:55] <roast> apparently it wasnt a good upgrade hah
[06:55] <syncore> well now, does it look like this: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=p5rFxh7y
[06:55] <syncore> that's exactly how mine looks on digitalocean and voice works on my servers
[06:56] <roast> ya ill try it inna bit

[00:02] <McAfee> lonewulf, dont discard the possiblity that one player is trolling the other.
[00:02] <lonewulf> McAfee: Hi, yeah I touched on that last night in here
[00:02] <McAfee> Yakumo`, it seemed more expensive than everything else, to me (except maybe with the free year option)
[00:03] <lonewulf> McAfee: On a different topic.. Mind telling me voteFlag number to disable g_weaponrespawn
[00:03] <McAfee> wmia3p5card, sv_master, makes your server communicate with the master server at valve, so that it can show up in the server lists.
[00:03] <McAfee> lonewulf 16384
[00:03] <lonewulf> Or where I can get a list of all the g_voteFlag commands?
[00:04] <lonewulf> McAfee: thanks man!
[00:05] <lonewulf> bertox: tried what?
[00:05] <bertox> custom maps
[00:05] <lonewulf> not really
[00:05] <bertox> bummer
[00:05] <bertox> trying to train noobies, wanted to add the csu defrag map to the list
[00:06] <lonewulf> gonna add the bloodrunblue and campgroundsblue, and the campgrounds with the green armor.
[00:07] <Yakumo`> yeah, someone wants me to install to ec2 for them on their free space, i just wondered if anyone had already done it
[00:07] <McAfee> bertox i suggest you test with the extra map pack by sponge first, before testing other random workshops which just may be broken
[00:07] <bertox> k, do you have a link to that?
[00:07] <McAfee> We used to use ec2 on my old job
[00:07] <bertox> or the id
[00:08] <McAfee> test this first, then move up from there: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539421606

[00:09] <zar-> lonewulf: do you care if i call him out?
[00:09] <zar-> i won't tell him how i know
[00:09] <McAfee> lonewulf zar-, looks to me like he's trolling him
[00:10] <bertox> McAfee - that appeared to work, looks like the other workshop item is the problem
[00:13] <McAfee> Yakumo`, i find the amazon instance for such a simple task, is wasting it, and it just seemed like the more expensive option overall, maybe amazon instance makes more sense for bigger projects?
[00:13] <pex> amazon is for real projects
[00:14] <pex> not crappy quake live servers, of which there are nearly 1400 empty
[00:14] <McAfee> Yakumo`, also amazon seem to be the less predictable in the sense of (total costs) because if you go over limits you pay more, and you won't know how far you go until you start (hence the purpose of their free year)
[00:15] <lonewulf> zar-: I dont care.. I wish we could drag him to my basement, and torture his ass for about a month.
[00:23] <McAfee> Yakumo`, without the free tier, the calculator reporrs $9.52 on the instance alone, without storage or bandwidth, for that you get 1gb of ram, and 1 vCPU... most competition give you more for less on more traditional VPS.
[00:23] <McAfee> reports*
[00:25] <McAfee> oh yeah and  6 CPU Credits/hour, very important

[07:32] <bertox> best way to set to a factory game type?
[07:32] <bertox> server guide isn't very specific on the subject
[07:33] <McAfee> map command?
[07:33] <McAfee> map campgrounds duel
[07:34] <McAfee> the question isn't very specific either
[07:36] <bertox> i'm creating a ictf server, i created the json file with the set up. i assumed you need to set the game type to match?
[07:36] <bertox> or the server.cfg would need some variable to set to the json file
[07:36] <bertox> something along those lines
[07:37] <bertox> ah got it, never mind
[07:43] <McAfee> that would be the mappool file

[19:00] <zar-> lonewulf: a bit harsh.
[19:01] <zar-> sponge-: :(
[19:01] <lonewulftp> ?
[19:01] <zar-> lonewulftp: have you complained to sponge-  about the sarge bug?
[19:01] <lonewulftp> What I do this time?
[19:01] <lonewulftp> oh no i havent
[19:01] <zar-> >< lonewulf> zar-: I dont care.. I wish we could drag him to my basement, and torture his ass for about a month.
[19:01] <lonewulftp> But i did switch my servers back to x64
[19:01] <zar-> that's what I was referring to
[19:02] <lonewulftp> lol
[19:02] <zar-> oh really? do you like it better?
[19:02] <lonewulftp> I dont see the sarge bug as much on x64
[19:03] <zar-> I don't think it's related to the bitset
[19:03] <zar-> it's some repeatable set of steps you can take to make it fail to load the model files
[19:04] <lonewulftp> and I dont see the "Disconnected from Steam...Reconnected to Steam" as much in x64 server as well

[22:02] <zar-> McAfee: it's where enemy models are all the default 'sarge' model and you can't change it back to keel/bright
[22:02] <zar-> without everyone joining spec only and then revoting the map
[22:02] <zar-> sponge-: !!!!
[22:14] <McAfee> :O
[22:14] <McAfee> a repetition of sarge models can only mean one thing.... Invasion
[22:15] <roasticle> we have been infected by the sarge virus
[22:15] <roasticle> there is no escape.
[22:40] <lonewulf> Give Sarge back his Cigar, and I just know that his forcing of enemy models will stop.

[22:49] <crushjz> Hello everyone :P
[22:49] <crushjz> I have an issue with the servers, they keep shutting down. This is the error:
[22:49] <crushjz> Sys_Error: shutting down idle dedicated server after sv_idleExit (120) seconds Shutdown tty console
[22:50] <crushjz> How should I do to prevent them to being shut down?
[22:51] * Danmer has quit IRC (Signed off)
[22:54] <roasticle> set sv_idleExit "1"
[22:54] <roasticle> // Exit the server if idle (not running a map) for a specified time. This will allow it to automatically restart
[22:54] <roasticle> // in the case of a game error or other problem. A value of "1" is recommended, but not default, when you are running
[22:54] <roasticle> // the server detached from the terminal.
[22:54] <roasticle> set sv_idleExit "1"
[22:55] <roasticle> thats my setting, perhaps you want a higher one than 120 yourself
[22:55] <roasticle> in server.cfg

[23:53] <lonewulf> I just checked houseofquake.factories, thinking maybe something in there is causing your server Shutdowns. (I didnt really see anything)
[23:54] <lonewulf> Like for me..If I re-cache all my workshop.txt stuff.. 
[23:54] <lonewulf> I always have to go back into the 
[23:54] <lonewulf> qcon2015.factories file
[23:54] <lonewulf> and change
[23:54] <lonewulf> g_warmupReadyDelay 
[23:54] <lonewulf> to 
[23:54] <lonewulf> 120
[23:54] <lonewulf> instead of the default 
[23:54] <lonewulf> 0
[23:54] <lonewulf> setting.
[23:55] <lonewulf> little bit of pain, but nothing major
[23:55] <lonewulf> Thats what made me think to check the houseofquake.factories.
[23:55] <lonewulf> but all looks ok there.
[23:56] <lonewulf> qcon2015.factories duel section that is.
[23:56] <lonewulf> ca and tdm doesnt have the warmupReadyDelay.

[00:02] <McAfee> did you try looking why it went idle in the 1st place?
[00:04] <PerpetualWar> crushjz, your startup script start random map , correct ?

[00:22] <crushjz> there is an issue tho. At the end of the match, there are not maps to vote. Just grey boxes at the bottom right.
[00:23] <McAfee> because you probasbly dont have a mappool

[00:24] <PerpetualWar> do you have a mappool ?
[00:24] <PerpetualWar> set in server.cfg file ?
[00:25] <PerpetualWar> I guess thats prob, server dont have any other map to go to
[00:25] <PerpetualWar> and stay idle
[00:25] <McAfee> it shouldn't stay idle either, it should be doing a map_restart

[00:37] <McAfee> how many maps do you have in there? what happens when you do a "callvote nextmap" ?
[00:40] * Danmer has quit IRC (Signed off)
[00:42] <crushjz> 6 maps in there.
[00:43] <crushjz> Not yet tried that, gimme a sec
[00:44] <crushjz> "No nextmap currently set"
[00:44] <crushjz> I think that's the issue. Thasnk McAfee
[00:45] <McAfee> you are not supposed to set it yourself
[00:45] <McAfee> it gets set by the mappool
[00:45] <McAfee> there something wrong reading the mappool
[00:47] <crushjz> Yep, I'll look into it
[00:50] <lonewulftp> Probably a typo on one or more of the maps in his mappool.txt
[00:51] <lonewulftp> Nice solve McAfee , Perp.
[00:52] <crushjz> Exactly, you got it.
[00:52] <crushjz> Thanks guys :P
