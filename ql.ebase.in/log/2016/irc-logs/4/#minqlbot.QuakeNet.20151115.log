[07:39] <MrButcher> mhhh i fiddled around with zmq rcon and stats this morning
[07:40] <MrButcher> i made the rcon script to work, but i had to specify the ip address 127.0.0.1
[07:40] <MrButcher> and this shows up during server start:

[10:22] <carmethene> Mino: I just had a vote fail 9-5
[10:22] <carmethene> I mean, it wasn't enough for the server to pass it
[10:22] <carmethene> but it should have been enough for qlx to auto-pass it anyway, but it didn't
[10:22] <carmethene> what's the actual threshold for passing those things
[10:22] <carmethene> ?
[10:22] <carmethene> server has 21 people

03[12:51] * LtC (~nnscript@oMgLunatiC.users.quakenet.org) has joined #minqlbot
[13:05] <@Mino> Hmm, that's interesting. It should've been passed at that point assuming default settings. It's passed if (number of votes)/(number of non-spec player) > 0.33 by default.

[13:12] <@Mino> Oh, I actually think I see the problem.
[13:14] <@Mino> Doesn't look like I check if a vote is currently active before firing off the "vote_called" event. So in the case someone tries to call a vote while a vote is active, it'll trip up the code in essentials.
[13:15] <@Mino> Gonna try confirming that's the case, and if it is, it'll be an easy fix.
[13:16] <@Mino> Yup, that's it.

[16:19] <sno> sure
[16:19] <@Mino> Thanks
01[16:52] <[ByQ]Descent> only windows installation?
[16:53] <@Mino> Depends on which one you're talking about. The old bot that runs on the client is Windows only, the new one runs on the dedicated server and is Linux only.
[16:54] <@Mino> The old one doesn't work at the moment, though. Haven't bothered updating it yet, since it's inferior in practically every aspect.
01[16:55] <[ByQ]Descent> ahh ok, looked at https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlbot
[16:56] <@Mino> Yeah, that's the old one. People kinda gathered here when I put up minqlx, so I just decided to keep this channel for both of them.
[16:56] <@Mino> The one in topic is the one you'll want to look at if you want the QLDS one.
01[16:57] <[ByQ]Descent> already .. =)

[17:29] <xLink> Mino: just trying to setup your server mod, getting ImportError: No module named 'redis'
[17:29] <xLink> redis is installed & running
[17:30] <@Mino> But not the Python module. Something must've failed under the easy_install/pip step.
[17:34] <xLink> gah
[17:38] <xLink> got it working :P
[17:38] <xLink> though this is throwing up a few times 
[17:38] <xLink> minqlx.zip/minqlx/_core.py:78: FutureWarning: split() requires a non-empty pattern match.
[17:39] <@Mino> That's fine. It's a bug in Python 3.5 and is fixed already, so it'll probably go away with 3.5.1.
[17:39] <xLink> ah cool
[17:46] <zurn> lol they are playing 5s against bots and losing
[17:46] <zurn> on my server
01[17:57] <[ByQ]Descent> Mino: sudo python3.5 -m easy_install pyzmq hiredis
01[17:57] <[ByQ]Descent> error while compiling
01[17:57] <[ByQ]Descent> error: Setup script exited with error: command 'i586-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
[17:58] <@Mino> i586? minqlx is x64 only atm, so even if that error is solved, it won't work.
01[17:59] <[ByQ]Descent> oops, it's local x32

[18:07] <zurn> Mino: at game end the bot says i'm a leaver but I never joined the game
[18:07] <zurn> did that two games in a row
[18:07] <@Mino> What versions are you on?
[18:08] <zurn> latest
[18:08] <zurn> 1.0.0
[18:08] <@Mino> Latest plugins too?
[18:08] <zurn> plugins 0.0.4.0
[18:08] <@Mino> k
[18:08] <xLink> Mino: how do you update the plugins? just git pull in the folder?
[18:09] <@Mino> Yup
[18:11] <@Mino> Not quite seeing where it could go wrong, zurn. Were you in spec all the time? You didn't join at all, even for a while?
[18:12] <zurn> I havent joined at all 
[18:17] <@Mino> That's really weird. I can't see why it would do that. Do you happen to know if someone else left in those games that should've been on that list instead?
[18:34] <Melodeiro> Mino: Which git command can i use for updating minqlx-plugins?
[18:34] <xLink> git pull
[18:34] <@Mino> git pull origin
[18:34] <Melodeiro> Even without .git http link?
[18:34] <@Mino> Yes
[18:35] <Melodeiro> Thanks!
[18:35] <xLink> you need to be in the right folder though
[18:35] <@Mino> Once you've cloned the repo, it saves all that stuff in the .git directory.
[18:35] <@Mino> Yeah, that too
[18:35] <Melodeiro> Ok
[18:42] <Melodeiro> Hmm i just renamed my old minqlx-plugins folder for best results, did git clone https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx-plugins.git and there is no .git folder
01[18:42] <[ByQ]Descent> ..it's new version testing? 
[18:43] <Melodeiro> Guess yes
[18:43] <@Mino> If you did a simple "ls" then directories starting with a period don't show up.
[18:43] <@Mino> You need to do "ls -a" for that.
[18:43] <@Mino> But you don't even need to worry about the .git directory anyway.
[18:44] <@Mino> Your working directory needs to be minqlx-plugins, not the .git.
[18:44] <Melodeiro> No, i "cd .git" and "git pull origin" which both told me that .git not exists
[18:45] <Melodeiro> Omg i just need to do it from minqlx-plugins xD
[18:45] <@Mino> Yup
[18:45] <Melodeiro> Now it works
[18:58] <xLink> Mino: the redis instance stores what?
01[19:04] <[ByQ]Descent> =)

[19:35] <kanzo> changing cg_autohop resets name back to normal
[19:41] <@Mino> Yeah, I'll fix that. Handicap and rail colors probably do to.
[19:41] <@Mino> xLink: Permissions, MOTDs, games left/completed if leaver ban is on, bans, etc. etc.
[19:41] <xLink> Mino: okay, does it matter if multiple instances are connected to the same redis db
[19:42] <@Mino> No. Unless you want that stuff to be separate, that's the recommended way of doing it.
[19:45] <xLink> ^^
