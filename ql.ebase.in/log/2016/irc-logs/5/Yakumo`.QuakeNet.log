[11:06] <[ByQ]Descent> hi
[11:06] <Yakumo`> hi, what's up?
[11:06] <[ByQ]Descent> this morning someone was using aimbot
[11:06] <[ByQ]Descent> Using-Aimbot-(ql-ebase-in)-(Frankfurt-1-FFA)-(19-12-2015)-(11-00).zip
[11:06] <[ByQ]Descent> http://ql.ebase.in/Using-Aimbot-(ql-ebase-in)-(Frankfurt-1-FFA)-(19-12-2015)-(11-00).zip
[11:06] <Yakumo`> there's a steam link to send in such things somewhere
[11:06] <[ByQ]Descent> ?
[11:07] <Yakumo`> oh, no, apparently not : https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/7/616189106356297351/
[11:08] <[ByQ]Descent> ..
[11:12] <Yakumo`> grabbed the steamid from the demo anyway http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198269074170
[11:14] <[ByQ]Descent> thnx, is this kind of public hack? means only bannin?
[11:14] <Yakumo`> there's no way I could know what hack they're using
[11:16] <Yakumo`> i've done all i can really, i'd be a little suprised if sponge puts a manual ban on them though, because like steam, they too don't want to be dealing with user submissions at all
[11:16] <Yakumo`> he'll be asleep now anyway
[11:17] <[ByQ]Descent> np =) thnx
[11:18] <[ByQ]Descent> so steam has to do kind of job "patch-software" ?
[11:18] <Yakumo`> fyi i dug their steamid out frm info / commands tab using uberdemotools. but if you have a recent game with a player you can just click their name in the in game stats to jump to profile.
[11:18] <[ByQ]Descent> or id
[11:19] <Yakumo`> steam just runs VAC, they don't touch other peoples software
[11:19] <Yakumo`> someone working for them, id, or just anyone that found a hack to submit needs to send the hack in to get added for detection
[11:20] <Yakumo`> https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869 
[11:21] <Yakumo`> 'reporting a new cheat'
[11:21] <[ByQ]Descent> problem not in players-profile-ban ... just explorin how the things go ... 
[11:21] <[ByQ]Descent> thnx

[11:23] <[ByQ]Descent> ERROR: 6851422061
[11:23] <Yakumo`> ..you shouldn't register
[11:23] <Yakumo`> just log into your steam account
[11:23] <[ByQ]Descent> steam account doesnt work ..
[11:25] <Yakumo`> oh yeah, my miistake
[11:26] <[ByQ]Descent> =)
[11:58] <[ByQ]Descent> I have specific feeling: Steam, Id, Quakelive and etc. consists only Yakumo,sponge and a bit community + number of servers and software working in half-auto-half-zombie mode ...
[11:59] <Yakumo`> I don't work for id...
[11:59] <Yakumo`> Or steam
[12:00] <Yakumo`> everyone knows the QL team was just 2 people for a few years (sync and sponge)
[12:00] <Yakumo`> Valve/Steam has hundreds of employees though.
[12:01] <[ByQ]Descent> you doing it the whole morning.. 
[12:01] <[ByQ]Descent> btw sync from us?
[12:02] <[ByQ]Descent> valve not ql
[12:02] <[ByQ]Descent> seems that ql's running in zombie mode for sure ..
[12:06] <Yakumo`> they said the steam exclusive version was the last version, bar any major bug fixes that have to be done.
[12:07] <[ByQ]Descent> not sure.. As I see Valve is dead, Steam is dead. means that somethin will happen soon ... only ql is kind of  "not-dead-not-alive" ...
[12:11] <Yakumo`> heh...
[12:11] <Yakumo`> Valve release products every year, and the beta steam client gets updates pretty much daily
[12:14] <[ByQ]Descent> the question what products and what updates and "problem-where-to-go" ...
[12:18] <Yakumo`> dota2, cs:go stuff, tf2 stuff, steam OS, steam controller...
[12:18] <[ByQ]Descent> because ~100% steam games just formal,not lan-inernet support (!!!) >:-[ ] - who needs c&c without servers and player?, market one-payment "strategy"  is "road-to-hell" ...
[12:18] <[ByQ]Descent> cs & ql
[12:18] <[ByQ]Descent> but cs wasnt online game... it's club game ..
[12:19] <[ByQ]Descent> steam os ..... :D
[12:19] <[ByQ]Descent> ql. not-dead-not-alive.
[12:21] <[ByQ]Descent> 125fps almost offline ..
[12:21] <[ByQ]Descent> streams are gone ..
[12:22] <[ByQ]Descent> .. and etc ..
[12:22] No such nick
