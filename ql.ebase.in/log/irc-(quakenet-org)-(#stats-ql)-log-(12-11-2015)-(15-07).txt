[13:15] <@PredatH0r> just what the world needs... yet another website framework
[13:17] <@PredatH0r> 0 documentation and even the project start page doesn't mention what it is all about
[13:17] <@PredatH0r> good chance to become the next hot thing :)

[19:24] <@PredatH0r> inl, rules: i was thinking a bit about the stats tracking system
[19:24] <@PredatH0r> and had the idea to use a tiny game-server-side nodejs tool instead of a direct zmq connection
[19:25] <@PredatH0r> that would allow a couple things which are currently not possible
[19:26] <@PredatH0r> game servers could store their jsons locally and trackers can load them with a small delay when there was an outage
[19:26] <@PredatH0r> the local nodjs could use an rcon connection to pull additional info from the server, like the whole configvars
[19:27] <@PredatH0r> and the local nodejs with rcon could send an infomessage to each connecting player
[19:28] <@PredatH0r> it could also listen to console chat and could react on commands like "!shuffle" if that is desired
[20:25] <@inl> i like that idea quite a bit
[20:25] <@inl> i'd dare say we could have both actually
[20:26] <@inl> register server online makes it easy for mainstream user
[20:26] <@inl> hard core admins will have to option to go deeper
[20:26] <@rulex> make it a minqlx plugin
[20:27] <@inl> i don't know how minqlx is integrating with ql at first i thought it just was zmq rcon integration
[20:27] <@inl> but he hooks into the game somehow?
[20:27] <@rulex> yes
[20:27] <@rulex> but also to zmq stats
[20:28] <@rulex> could even do a minqlx plugin to automagically register a server on the site when a ql server starts
[20:29] <@rulex> that would actually be neat
[20:29] <@rulex> the plugin lets us know which ip/host/pass to connect to..?
[20:29] <@inl> hmm
[20:30] <@inl> we need some way to authenticate the user
[20:30] <@rulex> u set your steam id in minqlx
[20:30] <@inl> POST /server { information in json }
[20:31] <@inl> I would say that they'd have to register online to and acquire a authentication key/token.
[20:31] <@rulex> sure that works
[20:32] <@inl> stea
[20:36] <@rulex> :D
[20:38] <@PredatH0r> since minqlx doesn't run on my windows server, i won't be writing any plugins that depend on it
[20:39] <@PredatH0r> also requiring admins to use minqlx ... something i rather avoid when possible
[20:40] <@rulex> but another plugin instead? :)
[20:40] <@PredatH0r> well, i dunno. i'm just thinking out loud
[20:41] <@PredatH0r> i mean there is only 2 or 3 windows ded servers out there, so i understand when nobody cares about those
[20:41] <@PredatH0r> unlucky for me, i have one of them
[20:42] <@rulex> :D
[20:42] <@rulex> infinitely more love than linux client
[20:43] <@PredatH0r> i came up with the idea because i want to run a special server where i need to send out a welcome/info message to each connecting client
[20:43] <@PredatH0r> for that i'd need a script that connects to zmq to get connection-notification and to rcon to be able to print out text
[20:44] <@PredatH0r> and the other thought was to have the servers cache their JSONs in case a tracker is temporarily offline
[20:46] <@PredatH0r> unrelated to that: i talked to sirax yesterday. he said that qlranks was running on a 8core, 32gb ram machine and had 80% cpu utilization 24/7 and millions of API calls each day
[20:46] <@PredatH0r> db itself was ~10gb
[20:50] <@inl> i'm pretty sure you can solve that with ql-server-monitor npm package
[20:51] <@inl> hmm, sounds like they didn't do caching properly.
[20:51] <@PredatH0r> maybe. dunno. putting steamid+elo into redis sounds like a good idea
[20:52] <@inl> i'd say even more stuff and have cachening in-front of that
[20:52] <@PredatH0r> that stuff was queried from extraQL userscripts all over the place
[20:52] <@inl> like an api call to /players/online can easily be cached for 15-30 secs
[20:52] <@PredatH0r> yea, all data for the 1000 or so last active users could be kept in-memory
[20:53] <@inl> mongodb sorts that for us i think
[20:53] <@inl> thing is with redis is that you need to flatten out your json objects
[20:54] <@inl> storing json as string and JSON.parse, not so keen on it tbh
[20:54] <@PredatH0r> i wouldn't store any jsons there ... or really only tiny ones suitable for JSON.parse
[20:54] <@inl> anywho, my daughter just feel asleep and wife is out so i'm going to spend time on coding.
[20:56] <@inl> my hope is that i can get a react.js app framework up and make the refactoring of ql-stats-engine to work (it's a major overhaul) but it'll make it really easy to understand the code, where to put persistance into redis and mongo and when to perform calculations for rankings etc.
[20:57] <@PredatH0r> i got my NoSQL book today that I ordered on the weekend. funny enough in the intro they mention the same 2 reasons why to use NoSQL that i came up with after reading in the web
[20:57] <@inl> that includes a first draft of the data model
[20:57] <@inl> PredatH0r nice!
[20:58] <@inl> i'm thinking that it might be and idea to create a github organization and put repositories there
[20:58] <@PredatH0r> it's basically faster development when you dont have to deal with data mapping... or clustering
[20:58] <@inl> oh yes
[20:58] <@inl> mongodb/nosql has made me so much faster when developing
[20:59] <@PredatH0r> but it comes at a price. the db is no longer suitable for application integration (if there is more than one app) and it lacks consistency, like atomic transactions between 2 tables provide
[21:00] <@inl> yeah, wouldn't make much sense for transactional data
[21:00] <@PredatH0r> anyhow, neither should be really a show-stopper for this project
[21:00] <@inl> like banking / trading etc
[21:01] <@PredatH0r> you already have this problem here, when you have a "games" collection and a "players" collection where you keep running tallies
[21:01] <@PredatH0r> there's no way to guarantee the the two can be kept in sync
[21:01] <@inl> i'm actually thinking of embedding documents within documents, for instance, appending player stats at a certain point into a game stats document.
[21:02] <@inl> but that's just loose thought i had, i need to contemplate it a bit more
[21:02] <@PredatH0r> i would certainly do that
[21:03] <@PredatH0r> that's when nosql starts getting a performance benefit over rdbms, when you embed data
[21:04] <@PredatH0r> i mean, the per-game-player-stats should go inside the game data. but still have a separate players collection with running tallies over all matches of the player
[21:10] <@PredatH0r> thinking about it a bit more... i start to like the minbotql thing
[21:11] <@PredatH0r> like auto-adding a "stats" or "ranked" tag so i can find the servers easier

[12:05] <@PerpetualWar_> hey
[12:05] <@PerpetualWar_> rulex
[12:05] <@PerpetualWar_> you here ?
[12:05] <@rulex> sure
[12:06] <@PerpetualWar_> hey
[12:06] <@PerpetualWar_> rulex
[12:06] <@rulex> hi
[12:06] <@rulex> :)
[12:06] <+smove> hi there
[12:06] <@PerpetualWar_> smove will install his pickip bot
[12:06] <@PerpetualWar_> for our channel
[12:06] <@PerpetualWar_> is there some api ready for him to take your stats for balancing ?
[12:08] <@rulex> don't think anyone have team based rankings implemented yet
[12:08] <@rulex> only elo for duels
[12:08] <+smove> we have for #ctfpickup since years already
[12:09] <@PerpetualWar_> ye inl is doing that
[12:09] <@PerpetualWar_> I think
[12:09] <@rulex> but you have your own system there
[12:09] <+smove> and balancing ca should be far easier
[12:09] <+smove> yes
[12:09] <@rulex> dont know anything about that
[12:09] <@PerpetualWar_> ok we need to ask inl I thnk
[12:10] <@PerpetualWar_> and wdx could provide formulas
[12:10] <@rulex> its not wdx bot?
[12:11] <+smove> the ctf one?
[12:11] <+smove> that's our
[12:11] <+smove> mute and I have written it
[12:12] <@rulex> and do you have some ranking?
[12:12] <+smove> PerpetualWar_: we can easily come up with a decent formular for CA team balancing. I can get mute to help me with that
[12:12] <+smove> we have
[12:12] <@PerpetualWar_> ye ok
[12:12] <+smove> unfortunately, we never made it public
[12:12] <@PerpetualWar_> mostly net dmg I guess
[12:12] <+smove> no
[12:12] <+smove> oh
[12:12] <+smove> right for ca
[12:12] <+smove> yes
[12:12] <+smove> :)
[12:12] <@PerpetualWar_> ^^
[12:13] <@rulex> or dmg/sec ;p
[12:13] <@PerpetualWar_> :D
[12:13] <@rulex> you should release it
[12:13] <+smove> rulex: I have to talk to mute about it again, maybe we can share the formular. mute isn't that open with the stuff he does
[12:13] <@rulex> :)
[12:13] <@PerpetualWar_> ye mute is anal about that
[12:14] <@rulex> hence the nick?
[12:14] <@rulex> :D
[12:14] <+smove> and I really don't want to overrule him even though I'm the main dev since a few years now
[12:14] <+smove> anyway, ctfpickup isn't an issue right now
[12:14] <+smove> it's more about ca really
[12:14] <@PerpetualWar_> ye
[12:14] <+smove> I've got no data as of yet
[12:15] <+smove> what I can do is, host servers and collect new data myself easily
[12:15] <+smove> I've started writing a daemon that does that
[12:15] <@rulex> i have quite a lot of data
[12:15] <+smove> is it accessable in any way?
[12:16] <+smove> accessible*
[12:16] <@PerpetualWar_> I can let you know my stats zmq pass smove, but i would prefer rulex's stats
[12:17] <@PerpetualWar_> for being larger and open source
[12:17] <@PerpetualWar_> somethng like centralized place
[12:17] <@rulex> http://c.leeto.fi:8585/api , but i might be dropping it and joining/exporting my data to inl project
[12:17] <+smove> who is inl, and what project?
[12:18] <@rulex> the dude in this chan
[12:18] <@PerpetualWar_> hm forgot his git
[12:18] <@rulex> https://github.com/swallentin/ql-stats-engine
[12:18] <@PerpetualWar_> you remember rulex?
[12:18] <@PerpetualWar_> oh ye
[12:19] <+smove> hm, lulz
[12:19] <@PerpetualWar_> basically smove, this channel is for all ppl who wanna cotribute
[12:19] <+smove> that's what I've started as well
[12:19] <+smove> basically
[12:19] <+smove> o0
[12:19] <@rulex> :D
[12:19] <@PerpetualWar_> then join forces maybe ?
[12:19] <@rulex> and i have the same except using python and mysql
[12:20] <@PerpetualWar_> only difference as I saw it
[12:20] <@PerpetualWar_> inl is actively developing it
[12:20] <@PerpetualWar_> and should have it ready fastets
[12:20] <+smove> but I did only file storage and main data stored to our DB that we need for ctfpickup so far, since I'm too busy to keep working on it constantly
[12:21] <@rulex> im also saving all raw json data to files and importing whatever i like
[12:21] <+smove> ye
[12:21] <+smove> same here
[12:21] == PerpetualWar_ changed the topic of #stats.ql to: :: Channel for people collaborating in efforts to create global ranking and balancing system for Quake Live :: https://github.com/swallentin/ql-stats-engine
[12:22] <+smove> I put MATCH_REPORT and PLAYER_STATS in one file per match
[12:22] <+smove> but that engine looks further developed already, I think
[12:23] <@rulex> i put all events in <match_guid>.zip
[12:23] <+smove> that's a lot of data if you put literally all events in there
[12:23] <+smove> but, ye, not bad
[12:23] <@PerpetualWar_> so smove stick around
[12:23] <@PerpetualWar_> when inl is online
[12:23] <@rulex> yes that shit is already 1.6g
[12:23] <+smove> I will
[12:23] <@PerpetualWar_> you can checkj withhiim
[12:23] <@PerpetualWar_> how far is he
[12:24] <@PerpetualWar_> and could you guys collaborate
[12:24] <+smove> I'm at work right now, but will look here every now and then
[12:24] <@PerpetualWar_> inl unofficially told me he will have balancing for other gametypes as well in app. 2-3 weeks
[12:24] <@PerpetualWar_> first draft at least
[12:25] <@PerpetualWar_> so far only elo for duel
[12:25] <@rulex> so many ideas and so much to do
[12:25] <@rulex> :)
[12:25] <+smove> ye
[12:25] <+smove> :x
[12:25] <@PerpetualWar_> ^^
[12:25] <@rulex> but no fucking time
[12:26] <+smove> btw, we still own playquake.com, maybe that might be useful? ;c
[12:26] <+smove> in a long run, at least
[12:26] <@PerpetualWar_> I would love to help but my codiing abilities are weak
[12:26] <+smove> dunno, just an idea
[12:26] <@rulex> PREDATH0R: has qlstats.net that i think he wants to get rid of
[12:26] <@PerpetualWar_> ye
[12:37] == PREDATH0R has changed nick to PredatH0r
[12:57] <@PredatH0r> i'm storing json.gz files which contain only match_report and player_stats. 6640 files so far, 8.5mb total
[12:58] <+smove> from what servers/gametypes?
[12:58] <@PredatH0r> that's one week of collecting, but many servers were added throughout the week
[12:58] <@PredatH0r> all gametypes that i have server access for
[12:58] <+smove> k
[12:58] <@PredatH0r> but most are duel or ca
[13:00] <@PredatH0r> 152 servers being tracked now
[13:02] <@PredatH0r> out of 1146 responsive server that i can see online
[13:02] <+smove> ql doesn't even have that many players
[13:02] <+smove> :D
[13:02] <@PredatH0r> 431 players on servers atm :)
[13:03] <+smove> tonight it'll be 100 more maybe
[13:03] <+smove> but that's it
[13:03] <+smove> :p
[13:03] <@PredatH0r> players or servers?
[13:03] <+smove> players ofc
[13:03] <@PredatH0r> it's gonna be a lot more. it was close to 1000 the other day
[13:04] <+smove> ye maybe close too, but ql doesn't have a huge playerbase really
[13:04] <+smove> to*
[13:04] <@PredatH0r> still the most popular afps from what i can tell
[13:05] <@PredatH0r> toxikk servers are empty 99.9995% of the time
[13:06] <@PredatH0r> dunno about ut4 stats, they use their own server browsing protocol unfortunately
[13:11] <@PredatH0r> 100 reflex servers, 2 players. also a good ratio
