<@PredatH0r> do you also persist the list for the case that redis goes down?
<+smove> inl: sounds good. it'll be more like a public thing where ppl can add their servers then or what is the overall intention?
<+smove> or to give ppl a tool to manage their server?
<@PredatH0r> and if everyone can add servers at will, you risk to get lots of junk into the database
<+smove> PredatH0r: there is no junk with bigdata (TROLOLOLO)
<+smove> ;p
<@PredatH0r> ofc not. it will all be useful some day to someone
<@PredatH0r> there needs to be some way to filter out matches with non-standard settings from getting ranked
<+smove> we're not even dealing with bigdata tbh. it's all well structured and well defined data
<+smove> ye
<+smove> that's the main issue really
<+smove> cause there is no indication if a custom factory was used, right?
<@rulex> there are factory names
<@PredatH0r> i think that there is the factory name in the data (not 100% sure). and the default ID-factories cannot be changed/faked
<@rulex> but you can set whatever settings u want
<@PredatH0r> custom factories can though
<@PredatH0r> true. that's why i thought about that server-side nodejs tool which can pull the configstrings through rcon
<@rulex> or do ranking/factory
<@rulex> :D
<+smove> well, that'll get messy still
<@PredatH0r> you can still load the standard CA factory and then change any g_*, pmove_, ... cvars during the match
<+smove> 2 different server can have the same factory name with totally different settings
<@PredatH0r> but i doubt that there is any way to make it bullet proof
<@PredatH0r> for collecting stats it doesn't really matter if the game is whacky or not. but for ranking it does
<@PredatH0r> that's why i thought about having relatively strict rules for ranked matches, similar to #tdmpickup or #ctfpickup
<+smove> you'd need to have ranked servers then with pre-defined factories that someone would provide, somewhere, somehow
<+smove> ye
<+smove> same thoughts basically
<+smove> :))
<@PredatH0r> is #ctfpickup using the default id factories or are there any special settings for it?
<+smove> we're using custom settings
<+smove> sec, I can show you what exactly
<+smove> http://pastebin.com/KUQf1PXs
<+smove> just so that we have proper classic ctf tbh
<@inl> just because they add the server does't mean we'll persist the data.
<@inl> admin's can apply for joining the ranked network.
<@inl> and once that get's approved we'll persist data.
<@inl> some sort of vetting needs to take place
<@PredatH0r> this is why i suggested to allow trackings stats for all servers, but exclude them from ranking when they dont meet the requirements.
<@PredatH0r> like having stats for iCTF is nice, but those should not go into the regular CTF ranking

<syncore> ayyyyyyyyyyyyy
<@PredatH0r> hola!
<@PredatH0r> was that a "hello!" or are you screaming out of agony?
<syncore> could be both i guess
* roasticle (roast@blk-30-134-45.eastlink.ca) has joined #stats.ql
<@PredatH0r> hi
<roasticle> howdy
* QBall147 (~QBall147@QBall147-.users.quakenet.org) has joined #stats.ql
<@PredatH0r> roasticle: so, inl is working on a brand new stats server/api/website and rulex joined forces from what i know
<@PredatH0r> ideally this system/database can also be used for #ctfpickup and #tdmpickup
<roasticle> with the global idea, how can you prevent bunk stats getting submitted?
<roasticle> im kinda in the early stages with what i was planning to do, have the db design laid out with event data i want to capture
<@PredatH0r> the stats tracker must connect to the game server and "pull" the data. so there is no way to just submit bogus data
<roasticle> i see
<@PredatH0r> the qlstats.net site will be obsolete when the new one is ready. for now i'm using the game server ip:port to identify each server
<roasticle> also a learning sort of project for me since im a LAMP webdev
<@PredatH0r> so someone would have to highjack the IP to send in bad data
<@PredatH0r> i see. inl is using mongodb and reactjs afaik
<@PerpetualWar_> smove coudl provide his ctf balancing formulas
<@PerpetualWar_> cosindering they have balancing already on #ctfpickup
<+smove> we have, since years
<+smove> ;p
<@PerpetualWar_> ^^
<@PerpetualWar_> I hope its not closed source as well smove ;P
<@PerpetualWar_> xD
<+smove> but I have to clarify if I can share the formular
<+smove> :x
<@PerpetualWar_> lol
<@PerpetualWar_> knew it :P
<@rulex> :D
<@PredatH0r> are these the formulas on http://qlstats.info/about-ql-statistics.html ?
<@rulex> share the love
<+smove> well, it's not me, I'm sorry
<@rulex> then why are you sorry
<@rulex> ;p
<+smove> I'm main dev (so to speak) since a few years now but I didn't start the project
<+smove> so I won't just share anything
<@PerpetualWar_> open source is love ;_
<@PerpetualWar_> ;)
<@rulex> oh yeah
<@rulex> #nohomo
<+smove> well, I know
<+smove> I'm working for one of the largest since april, so... ;c
<@PerpetualWar_> especially in communtiy which thrives on collaboration and mutula respect like ours :D
