<[ByQ]Descent> hi
<PredatH0r> hi
<[ByQ]Descent> about servers
<[ByQ]Descent> instagib-1 Minsk not ranked ..
<[ByQ]Descent> not in server list
<PredatH0r> which ip:port ?
<[ByQ]Descent> 178.124.139.88:27968
<[ByQ]Descent> and maybe some others
<[ByQ]Descent> duel Minsk
<PredatH0r> it's in the config file though. it might not show up if nobody finished a game on it
<[ByQ]Descent> I did it =)
<[ByQ]Descent> duel and instagib for sure
<[ByQ]Descent> =)
<PredatH0r> hmm, i didn't see any match uploads for your IPs in a while
<PredatH0r> i restarted the stats tracker, seems to connect fine
<[ByQ]Descent> can you receive the image?
<PredatH0r> nope, wont go though my router
<[ByQ]Descent> sec

<PredatH0r> one match just got uploaded for 178.124.139.88:27963
<PredatH0r> someone said that if the servers are idle for some time, they stop sending stats info until a reconnect
<PredatH0r> maybe that's really the case
<PredatH0r> because there were no error messages
<[ByQ]Descent> they not in server list
<[ByQ]Descent> http://qlstats.net:8080/search?fs=&server_name=Minsk
<[ByQ]Descent> can it be other port?
<PredatH0r> i know. for some unknown reason i didn't receive any data. i reconnected, so it should be fine now
<PredatH0r> you won't see the server until a match was loaded into the database
<PredatH0r> the data for the past matches is lost. no way to get that information after the match is over
<[ByQ]Descent> .. ok ..
<[ByQ]Descent> thnx
<PredatH0r> np. let me know when no matches show up after a while. it's a bit hard to keep an eye on 150 servers in the list
<[ByQ]Descent> ok.
<[ByQ]Descent> yep, there were kind of "idle" time
<[ByQ]Descent> http://qlstats.net:8080/server/83
<[ByQ]Descent> but there were games for sure ..
<[ByQ]Descent> ok
